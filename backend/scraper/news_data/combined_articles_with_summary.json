        "raw_text": "Cricket Australia (CA) is open to the introduction of private ownership and expansion in its Big Bash Leagues in the coming years as it looks to expand the successful competitions. The CA board commissioned the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to provide recommendations for the next phase in both the BBL and the WBBL, with the report including four suggestions. The report suggests an \"optimised schedule\" that would allow the BBL to attract top international players from around the world while also enhancing the availability of Australia's international stars. This would come in the form of a later start to the season and a higher salary cap. CA has also been recommended to consider \"alternative forms of investment and ownership\", with private ownership included in this. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines. Other recommendations include the introduction of different operating models and administrative structures and the potential for league expansion. No decisions have been made yet on the potential implementation of the recommendations coming out of the BCG report. \"We will work closely with the states and territories, the Big Bash clubs, the players and our broadcast and commercial partners to consider the recommendations on how this value can be unlocked,\" CA chair Mike Baird said in a statement. \"It is very important to understand that no decisions have yet been made, and that any action taken will be for the benefit of the BBL, WBBL, fans, and Australian cricket more broadly. \"That would include providing strong benefits across the game, including investment in participation initiatives and player development.\" CA CEO Todd Greenberg said the T20 format had boosted the game globally, attracting new audiences and increasing participation. \"We need to ensure that the Big Bash remains among the world's top sporting competitions,\" Greenberg said. \"We will now undertake an exploratory process of the recommendations in this report to ensure any action we take achieves this potential and is in the best interests of Australian Cricket and cricket fans.\" The next season of the WBBL will commence on November 9 and end on December 13. It will then be followed by the BLL, which runs from December 14 to January 25 in 2026.",

        "raw_text": "A Hunter Valley man has been convicted and fined in a New South Wales court after pleading guilty to sending an NRL player a death threat on social media. Joseph Baldwin, 20,was arrested and charged in Juneafter screenshots of graphic messages he sent to Newcastle Knights winger James Schiller on Instagram were circulated online. Schiller, 24, received the messages on social media after a game against the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles on June 5 at Hunter Stadium. The messages included, \"Count your days \u2026 I will end your f***ing life\". Screenshots of the direct messages sent to James Schiller on social media were shared by teammates.(Instagram: Jackson Hastings) Baldwin was arrested a week later and charged with using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend. In Belmont local court on Wednesday, Baldwin pleaded guilty to the charge. In sentencing, Magistrate Stephen Barlow expressed his shock at the graphic nature of the messages, which included a \"direct threat to end his [Schiller's] life\". \"More than harsh, they're actually quite threatening,\" he said. \"The victim was concerned for his own safety, and the safety of his family. Baldwin's lawyer Robert Williams asked the court to consider not recording a conviction, to allow him to \"continue his life with an unblemished record\". But Magistrate Barlow recorded a conviction over the charges, and fined Baldwin $750. Prior to sentencing, Mr Williams asked the magistrate to allow his client to be excused from entering the courthouse, arguing there was \"intimidating media\" outside. However, Mr Williams later agreed Baldwin would need to approach and enter the court to deal with the matter in person. The court heard James Schiller was worried for his family's safety after receiving the messages.(ABC News: Bridget Murphy) Magistrate Barlow said the charges against Baldwin included a \"concerning death threat\" made to Mr Schiller \"on the basis that he hasn't played well enough in a rugby league game\". The court heard Baldwin was extremely remorseful and apologetic over the messages. \"He will never send a message like this again,\" Mr Williams said. The defence lawyer also told the court Baldwin wanted to write Schiller a \"very sincere letter of apology\", if that would be welcomed by the victim. Two character references were handed up to the court, which Magistrate Barlow said detailed Baldwin as a \"reliable and level-headed young man\". The magistrate accepted he was young and immature, but said athletes in the public eye should be able to feel safe at work and in the community. \"Just because he is someone who is a public figure, doesn't mean he should have to have a more resilient personality than anyone [else] in the community,\" Magistrate Barlow said.",

        "raw_text": "West Coast chief executive Don Pyke has confirmed the struggling club will make a formal request for AFL draft assistance after four years in the doldrums. The Eagles are facing the prospect of a one-win season, which would be the worst result in club history, as they head towards a second wooden spoon in three years. ABC Sport is live blogging every round of theAFLandNRLseasons in 2025. A powerhouse off the field, West Coast have won just 11 of their past 91 games in a barren run that has included a raft of injuries to key players. Pyke on Wednesday said the Eagles had already had \"initial discussions\" with the AFL about what an assistance package could look like. He said the Eagles would weigh up multiple options, rather than simply requesting an extra high-end national draft selection. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines. \"We find ourselves right in the position where if you apply it across clubs who have recently received assistance \u2026 we're well and truly in the window for that,\" Pyke said on SEN. \"We'll have those discussions and we'll proceed with some sort of request. \"We feel like, as disappointing as it is, we are where we are. \"And with the draft as compromised as it's been, we feel like we can benefit from some assistance to get ourselves out of where we've been.\" Pyke likened West Coast's position to that of North Melbourne, the most recent club to receive draft assistance from the AFL in 2023. The Kangaroos received three end-of-first-round selections for the drafts in 2023 and 2024, as well as extra rookie-list spots. North had finished each of the previous four seasons in the bottom two on the ladder, winning just 12 of 84 games. West Coast will already have the number one draft pick if they finish last this year and will receive another high-end selection as compensation if, as expected, sought-after captain Oscar Allen moves to a rival club through free agency. Captain Oscar Allen will be a free agent at the end of this season.(AAP: Richard Wainwright) Pyke's comments came the week after key AFL officials hosed down speculation about the Eagles receiving a priority pick. AFL chief executive Andrew Dillon and new league football performance boss Greg Swann both urged West Coast to follow the example set by clubs such as Brisbane and Adelaide in plotting a path out of the doldrums. But Pyke said a draft compromised by academy and father-son selections, as well as compensation picks, made it difficult for clubs to rebuild. \"Unfortunately, in the last two years, when we've finished in the bottom three, our first pick in the second round has slid out to the 30s,\" he said. \"This draft is very much the same situation. \"There's going to be six to eight, if not nine, of those types of players that will impact on the selection order, which just means access to talent for teams like ourselves who are trying to build just gets more challenging.\" AAP",

        "raw_text": "Simone McKinnis stunned the netball world when she announced her 13th season at the Melbourne Vixens would be her last. It proved the turning point that took the Vixens from strugglers to Super Netball grand finalists, and now they will hope to ride that wave of emotion to glory. Melbourne will face the West Coast Fever in Saturday's decider at John Cain Arena after mounting an emotional comeback from 10 goals down at the final change to beat the NSW Swifts by one goal last week. An incredible speech from outgoing coach Simone McKinnis ensured her tenure with the Melbourne Vixens has the chance to have a fairytale ending. It meant McKinnis's decorated career would stretch into one more game \u2014 a tilt at a third national league title. McKinnis announced after her 200th game in May \u2014 a defeat to Sunshine Coast Lightning \u2014 that she would be moving on, before later joking her \"flat\" charges, then sitting 2-4, needed to head to the pub. Since then, Melbourne has won eight of 10 games to reach their second consecutive decider. \"The turning point was moving on, having that announcement,\" McKinnis said on Wednesday. \"It was just, 'Alright, that's out there. Let's just go and have fun.' \"I think that was the turning point for us.\" The Vixens produced a stirring comeback win over the NSW Swifts to reach the Super Netball grand final.(Getty: Mark Kolbe) McKinnis admitted a third triumph would be particularly special. \"It'd be enormous. It would be brilliant,\" she said. \"Because I'm just so super proud of how we've got here from where we started this season, and how we've got to this position, and I'm not sure that many people would have seen us in the grand final. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines. \"So, I'm just super proud of the girls.\" Defender Kate Eddy started her career as a training partner at the Vixens and, apart from two years at the Swifts, has only played under McKinnis. She and her teammates, fuelled by the fire of losing last year's grand final to NSW, are trying not to think too much about their coach's last hurrah. \"After the siren goes, I think it'll be lots of emotions and everything as well next week,\" Eddy said. \"But trying to put out all of my energy and focus into this week, because obviously Simone means the world to all of us and to me as well. \"So, it'll be really hard. But try not to think about that too much.\" Fever star Jhaniele Fowler-Nembhard looms as a major obstacle between the Vixens and their fairytale ending.(AAP: Richard Wainwright) First, the Vixens need to get the better of the Fever, who have beaten them twice this season, with star goaler Jhaniele Fowler-Nembhard averaging 60 goals in those two games. Eddy stressed the Vixens' full-court defence needed to stop the ball getting to Fowler-Nembhard, while McKinnis wants her charges switched on early. \"You're never out of the contest until the whistle is gone and the final siren's gone. It's never over,\" McKinnis said. \"But \u2026 you can't afford to be giving a team like Fever that sort of head start. \"The important part for us is being able to put that pressure on and show our intent and purpose right from the first whistle.\" AAP",

        "summary": "Sarah Gigante finished third and as the Queen of the Mountains at the Giro d'Italia Donne earlier this month. The Tour de France Femmes has its first mountain stage on Wednesday's stage five.",
        "raw_text": "The Tour de France Femmes is well and truly underway, with four of the race's nine stages already done and dusted. Those flat stages were the preserve of the fast women: Marianne Vos. Lorena Wiebes. Kim Le Court Pienaar \u2014 sprinters and rouleurs having their fun before the real work begins in the mountains and hills of the east. Now, as the race continues its migration across France, the roads begin to climb. The Massif Central looms and then, the Alps. It is time for the mountain goats to flex their climbing muscles. Australian Sarah Gigante has rightly been looking forward to the mountains. The 24-year-old Victorian isfresh off finishing third overall and winning the mountains jersey at the Giro d'Italia Donne\u2014 only the second Aussie after Amanda Spratt in 2018 to win the maglia azzurra. Sarah Gigante (right) was not far from beating Elisa Longo Borghini at the Giro d'Italia Donne.(Getty Images: Luc Claessen) She won two stagesin that race\u2014 the two most mountainous ones, at that. In fact, had Gigante not been caught out on a crosswind-affected sixth stage and lost almost 2 minutes overall, she may well have been hailed as Australia's first women's grand tour champion. What was all the more incredible was it came after Gigante spent six months out following major surgery. \"Last December, I had a major surgery, basically to unkink and remove some scar tissue from my iliac artery, which was really a big surgery,\" Gigante told ABC Sport. The Victorian rider required the operation due to a thinning of the artery that transports blood down to her right leg, resulting in numbness and pain. It is increasingly common in endurance athletes, particularly cyclists, due to the constant flexing of the hip. \"I've had quite a lot of operations in the past for broken bones but that's quite standard for cyclists, whereas this was more risky coming back from and took a long time,\" Gigante said. \"It was a super cool feeling just to be on the start line again [at the Giro] and racing against the world's best. \"To have a breakout week was just beyond all my dreams.\" Sarah Gigante won two stages at the Giro d'Italia Donne.(Getty Images: Luc Claessen) Gigante is not wrong about requiring a frequent flyer card for her local operating theatre. As well as multiple broken bones, she had previously required treatment for myopericarditis, an enlargement of the lining of the heart, in 2021. Gigante is already an incredibly high achiever. She graduated from the University of Melbourne with a double degree in geography and linguistics as a Chancellor's Scholar off the back of an incredible 99.95 ATAR score. The year after, Giganteburst onto the road cycling scene by claiming the Australian road race title as an 18-year-old. But, successful Giro aside, her primary focus at the Tour Gigante has been to help AG Insurance-Soudal team leader Kim le Court-Pienaar, to an impressive degree of success so far. Le Court finished second on stage oneand third in stage two, which was enough for the Mauritian to take the yellow jersey for a single day. She currently sits third overall, 12 seconds behind Dutch legend Vos. Sarah Gigante's teammate, Kimberley Le Court Pienaar, wore the yellow jersey on stage three.(Getty Images: Szymon Gruchalski) So now, with the road starting to point upwards, is the former Australian national champion looking at her own goals? \"I don't think my goals have changed,\" Gigante said, prior to the race getting started. \"But I do feel that I have both more confidence and less pressure at the same time, which is a really nice feeling.\" The first four stages have not been exactly flat, with an average elevation gain of 1,179 metres on each stage. But Wednesday's fifth stage sees a leap to 1,843m elevation gain in 165.8km of racing on the road from Futuroscope to Gu\u00e9ret, the majority of which takes place in the final 60km. When the road heads into the mountains, Sarah Gigante gets into her element.(Getty Images: Tim de Waele) From that point on, the road gets steeper and more mountainous, culminating with a colossal eighth stage on Saturday night, where the peloton will climb 3,600m in just 111.9km of racing, finishing on the legendary Col de la Madeleine. There is then another 3,000m climbing day on Sunday featuring the Col de Joux Plane and Col du Corbier before an uphill finish to Ch\u00e2tel les Portes du Soleil on the Swiss border. \"It's a back-ended course design,\" Gigante said. \"The week starts with five rolling and punchy, shorter, sprintier stages, which suit Kim really well,\" Gigante said, \"They don't suit me well. \"I just have to try to get through and, if I can limit time loss on the general classification for myself as well, that will be a helpful bonus coming into the hillier and harder stages. \"If I am still up there in the overall classification, I think we will have two cards to play.\" Sarah Gigante is still well in contention heading into the second half of the race.(Getty Images: Szymon Gruchalski) Job done. Gigante sits in 19th place overall after the fourth stage, just 51 seconds behind race leader Marianne Vos. More pressingly, she is just 29 seconds behind defending champion Katarzyna Niewiadoma and 26 seconds behind overall favourite Demi Vollering. In other words, well within striking distance of the race lead. And on roads well suited to the young Australian, who excels when the gradient gets steep enough for the air to be filled with the burning smell of clutches as support vehicles struggle to keep up. \"I like them more,\" Gigante said of the mountain stages. \"They're so challenging and when the going gets tough, the tough get going, that's what I like to think. \"When the bunch gets smaller and smaller and people are dropping off, everyone's legs are dying and you can hear the panting around you, that's when I really love it. \"You just learn to tune out \u2026 you're also embracing the pain, your legs are burning, your lungs are on fire, you're hopefully dropping others\u2026 \"It's a time when I can put the hurt on others. If I want to make it faster and that's my job, I can do it, which is a good feeling, being able to drop the other riders. Sarah Gigante excels on the steeper slopes.(Getty Images: Luc Claessen) \"But,\" Gigante adds, \"they can drop me and smash me on the sprintier stages\". No Aussie has won the Tour de France Femmes in its short three-year history, with Elizabeth Hepple's third place in the 1989 Tour de France F\u00e9minin the nation's only podium finisher in a Tour de France-affiliated stage race. The Tour de France Femmes produced one of the closest finishes in cycling stage race history last year. But when the women's Tour was first revived, it was called \"ugly\". In that 1984\u20131993 race, no Aussie won a stage, either, although in the Grande Boucle F\u00e9minine Internationale, a race unaffiliated with the Tour de France held between 1994 and 2009, Emma Rickards (2), Lynn Nixon (1), Juanita Feldhahn (1) and Anna Millward (1) all recorded stage wins. Additionally, Chloe Hosking won the 2016 edition of the one-day race La Course by Le Tour de France. Neither has an Aussie walked away with the famed polka dot jersey for the best climber at the Tour, but it is entirely possible that Gigante could break that jersey duck. The Tour de France Femmes is considered one of women's cycling's grand tours, but in truth the one-week stage race bears little resemblanceto the three weeks of torment the riders go through in the three men's grand tours. Those three races, the Tour de France, Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and Giro d'Italia, are the only stage races that last longer than a week on the men's tour. The Women's equivalents, although growing, are still just a week long, similar to other stage races such as the Tour Down Under. That is not from a lack of want, though, with Gigante keen for a longer race for the women. Good crowds have massed on the roadside to watch the Femmes.(Getty Images: Szymon Gruchalski) \"For sure,\" Gigante said when asked if she wanted the race to be longer than just a week. \"I'd like longer stages, hillier stages, more stages \u2026 The harder the better. \"This is my second Tour de France, I raced last year [finishing seventh overall], and it's one day longer [this year]. \"Especially, the diesel engine that I am, I think a longer tour would suit me better. \"But also I think it's what the fans are wanting. \"Last year was so exciting, there was only 4 seconds separating first and second overallat the end of the eight days. I don't expect it to be as close this year. But I do think it will be a really fierce battle. \"Even with the Giro, it wasn't really televised in Australia, but the mount of media and the number of people messaging me or commenting on Instagram was insane, and that's the Giro, not the Tour. \"I think the fanbase is really increasing for women's cycling. The riders are ready for it.\" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.",

Collingwood is weighing up whether to bring back Bobby Hill, who kicked three goals in the VFL in his return from personal leave, and Jordan De Goey, who had 19 disposals on limited minutes. \"In the ideal world, they probably do both need a little bit more [match minutes],\" McRae said. \"But we just weigh up what the team needs this week, and then what's best for those guys longer term. \"Are they fit and available to perform at a level that we'd like this week?\" AAP",

        "raw_text": "There are fresh calls to shut down Tasmania's greyhound racing industry following the death of one of the state's greatest ever runners earlier this week. WARNING: This story contains images of an animal suffering a serious injury and may cause distress. Raider's Guide, which had claimed a Tasmanian record of $664,975 in prize money from 79 starts, was put down after suffering a fall during Race 6 at Launceston on Monday night. The 4-year-old stayer bumped into another greyhound on the first turn of the race, forcing it to tumble and the race to be abandoned. According to the stewards' report, Raider's Guide was then taken to a veterinary clinic, and a post-race examination revealed it had suffered cervical spinal injuries which eventually proved to be fatal. TasRacing confirmed that Raider's Guide was euthanased as a result of its injuries. It is the second Tasmanian greyhound racing death this year, and the first at Launceston. Greyhound Raider's Guide fell during a race in Launceston.(Sky Racing) Animal welfare advocates believe the death of Raider's Guide further justifies their position that government subsidy for the greyhound racing industry in Tasmania should end. \"Grotesque track deaths are just the tip of a huge injury iceberg. There are thousands of greyhound track injuries in Australia every year according to the industry's own stewards' reports.\" Tasmanian Dog Walking Clubs is one of 11 community groups campaigning for an end to taxpayer-funded greyhound racing in Tasmania by 2029. \"The RSPCA and every other significant animal welfare group in Tasmania agree dog racing is unavoidably cruel,\" Ms Fraser said TasRacing chief executive Andrew Jenkins paid tribute to the greyhound. \"He will leave a legacy on Tasmanian and Australian greyhound racing for many years to come.\" Tasmanian government funding of the state's greyhound racing industry is rising faster than its spending on education, according to a new report finding $74.6 million has been poured into the sector over the past five years. In a statement, TasRacing said there had been a steady downward trend in greyhound \"racing-related mortality\", and that mortality had reduced by a factor of 7.5 since the 2016-17 financial year. In 2016-17, 15 greyhounds died from 12,724 starters, representing 1.18 greyhounds per 1,000 starters. The number of deaths peaked in 2018-19 when there were 18 deaths from 12,642 starters, but has reduced to 2 deaths from 11,927 starters or 0.17 per 1,000 so far this year. TasRacing says greyhound racing-related deaths have been decreasing.(ABC: Magie Khameneh) Raider's Guide was trained by Mangalore hall-of-famer Gary Fahey and was crowned Tasmania's Greyhound of the Year last year. In May, it became the first Tasmanian greyhound to win three Group 1 races when it won the Sandown Cup at Sandown Park in Victoria. But the death of Raider's Guide has emboldened calls for Tasmania to follow other jurisdictions in shutting down its greyhound racing industry. Last year, New Zealand's government decided to end greyhound racing, citing an \"unacceptably high\" rate of death and injury. It set up a committee to help manage a 20-month transition period for the industry, including the rehoming of almost 3,000 racing greyhounds. In February, Wales followed suit, with its government announcing it would end greyhound racing \"as soon as practically possible\". Some other jurisdictions have put a stop to greyhound racing.(AAP: David Moir) Greens animal rights spokesperson Cassy O'Connor said the Tasmanian greyhound racing industry was \"irredeemably cruel\" and should be wound up. \"It's because of the 'unacceptably high' rate of injury and death to dogs that the conservative New Zealand government committed to ending greyhound racing by the middle of next year,\" Ms O'Connor said. There are renewed calls for Tasmania to shut down its greyhound racing industry.(Unsplash) A report by independent economist Saul Eslake, commissioned by the 11 community groups campaigning for an end to taxpayer-funded greyhound racing, found state-owned Tasracing funds greyhound racing at more than double the rate of other states and territories. \"There does not appear to be a compelling reason \u2014 beyond inertia ('it has always been thus') \u2014 why Tasmanian greyhound racing should continue to receive the generous government funding which it has long enjoyed once the current funding deed expires in mid-2029,\" Mr Eslake wrote. Tasmanian Racing Minister Jane Howlett said the racing industry contributes \"significantly to our economy, supporting jobs, businesses and regional communities\". \"We know that the Tasmanian community want a racing industry that is fair, humane, and sustainable. \"A project to assess options for the next deed has commenced, being conducted by a working group overseen by the Department of Treasury and Finance and the Department of Natural Resources and Environment. \"We will provide an update once this work is completed. \"We are committed to supporting a strong future for racing in our state.\"",

        "raw_text": "India's head coach, Gautam Gambhir, has been involved in a confrontation with ground staff at The Oval during a training session before the fifth and final Test against England. Video footage from the net session shows Gambhir pointing his finger at Lee Fortis, Surrey's head of ground staff, and the India coach can be heard shouting \"you can't tell us what to do\" and \"you're just the groundsman, nothing beyond\". Reports from the ground suggested Fortis was concerned about the use of an ice box near the pitch. Speaking in a news conference afterwards, India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak \u2014 who was present during the incident \u2014 said the coaches were inspecting the wicket for the Test, and were asked to move away. \"When we were standing on the wicket looking at it, one of the ground staff came and said to stand two and [a] half metres away from here. In my cricketing career, I have never seen anybody saying that,\" Kotak said. \"Literally, he was saying that 'you can go outside the rope', to the head coach, and see the wicket. I don't know how you can see. \"If someone was brushing their shoes, or somebody is trying to put something on the wicket, or somebody wearing spikes \u2014 if the curator feels that, then fine \u2014 but it was a very strange way of saying it. \"Curators are a little over-protective or possessive about the square and the ground. [They] need to understand that the people they are talking to are highly skilled and intelligent people.\" With no specific outdoor practice area, India used three practice wickets surrounded by nets close to the Test match pitch, which is standard procedure. Fortis later downplayed the incident, telling Indian media, \"There's nothing to speak about. There's nothing to hide here\". \"You saw what he was like this morning. He's a bit touchy.\" A photo of Fortis standing on a pitch with England coach Brendon McCullum later emerged, however that photo was taken in 2023. The incident is the latest in a heated and competitive series between the two sides,with the fourth Test at Old Trafford ending with India refusing to shake hands for the draw earlyas Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar reached centuries. India skipper Shubman Gill also said England were acting \"against the spirit of cricket\" with time-wasting tactics during the third Test at Lord's. England lead the five-match series 2-1, and Ben Stokes's side is expected to make changes to the team from Manchester's draw, particularly to the bowling line-up after just three days in between Tests.",

        "raw_text": "Australian teenager Maya Joint has brought in-form local hope Leylah Fernandez crashing back down to Earth at the Canadian Open, where top seed Coco Gauff was given an almighty scare before advancing. Fernandez, a former US Open finalist now ranked 24th in the world, collected the biggest title of her career on Sunday when she won the DC Open in Washington, thrashing Anna Kalinskaya 6-1, 6-2 in the final. But her return home in triumph did not last long, with Joint beating the Quebec native 6-4, 6-1 in Montreal on Tuesday (local time). It was quick revenge for Joint, who lost 6-3, 6-3 to Fernandez in the first round in Washington. Fernandez later criticised the scheduling in Montreal, saying she had been hoping for extra rest before returning to the court in Canada. She said she had received \"a lot of promises\" that she would play during Tuesday's night session, giving her more time to recover between the two tournaments, but learned on Sunday while travelling that would not be the case. \"That hurt me because I was very looking forward to be playing at night, but I guess it's a little bit political issues at that point,\" Fernandez said. Instead, top-seeded Gauff played fellow American Danielle Collins to open the night session. Coco Gauff survived a major scare against American compatriot Danielle Collins to advance.(Getty Images: Minas Panagiotakis) Montreal tournament director Valerie Tetreault said she promised Fernandez she would \"fight so that she could have the time she wanted\", but that ultimately the WTA Tour determined scheduling. The scheduling almost backfired, with Gauff being pushed to the brink before squeaking past Collins 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (7-2). ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines. On a much happier note, Joint, ranked 45th in the world and already a two-time WTA title winner this year, now meets American 28th seed McCartney Kessler. If she wins that match, next in line would be rising Russian Mirra Andreeva, who is yet to play in Montreal having received a bye, then a walkover after Bianca Andreescu withdrew. That would be in the round of 32, a stage another Aussie has already reached. Seeded 15, Daria Kasatkina was given a bye in the first round, and on Tuesday she beat Anna Blinkova 6-1, 6-4. Kasatkina next faces 24th seed Marta Kostyuk, of Ukraine. Elsewhere, seventh seed seed Jasmine Paoloini was surprised by Japan's Aoi Ito 2-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), but eighth seed Emma Navarro progressed, as did ninth-seeded Elena Rybakina. AAP",

        "raw_text": "When looking to buy a new home to live in, you might be wondering whether it is best to sell your current property first. There are pros and cons to both buying and selling as the first move. What you decide will often depend on your individual circumstances. But there are some key things to consider, as we found out when talking to a real estate expert and mortgage broker for their insights. From rugs covering water damage, to artificial lighting making spaces look brighter, stylists use all kinds of tricks when staging a home for sale. Whether you buy or sell first is a \"really big decision\", says Real Estate Institute of Australia president Leanne Pilkington. \"Thirty years ago, people always used to sell before they bought \u2026 [but] because there are different financing options available today, some people do find the property they want first, then sell.\" When choosing what is best for you, she says it's important that people consider facts and take the emotion out of the decision. \"You need to understand where you are selling, what are the average days on market, and be mindful of what price you can get. \"Some people have an aspirational price for their property, but that can take longer to achieve. \"Be conservative, and look at [the] worst-case scenario, not best case.\" Broker and finance specialist Jaeneen Cunningham, based on the Gold Coast/Yugambeh language region, says people need an understanding of their financial situation and borrowing power before deciding what option will work for them. Ms Cunningham, who is also a member of the Mortgage and Finance Association of Australia, says people often experience FOMO (fear of missing out) when it comes to buying property, which can rush them into making the wrong decision. Buying first might mean you're able to secure the exact property you want without the time-pressure constraints of needing somewhere to live, explains Ms Pilkington. \"There are less properties on the market today than there have been in years gone by. \"People are staying in their homes longer \u2026 in part because it's so expensive to move.\" For that reason, Ms Pilkington says there is less choice, and it can take people longer to find something they really love. Ms Cunningham says having certainty around where you are moving to will also help with other decisions, such as school and work commitments. At 42, Amna did not want to join a share house or spend all her money on rent. She turned to house-sitting to save a deposit. It may also minimise the need for temporary accommodation between moves. \"By locking your next home in, you won't be in limbo, and it minimises that disruption or having to do multiple moves,\" Ms Cunningham says. The main drawback of buying first is financial pressure, she says. Not selling your current property first means you won't know how much money you've got exactly. And if you're current home takes longer to sell, Ms Cunningham says you could be paying for two mortgages. \"This could result in accepting a lower price on your property as you will feel pressure to offload it.\" You may also need bridging finance \u2014 a short-term loan that can help cover the gap between purchasing a new property and the sale of an existing one. The interest on bridging loans is usually more than the interest on standard home loans. Selling your current home first gives you better clarity on what buying power you have, say Ms Cunningham. Tune in this Sunday at 7.30pm on ABC TV or on ABC iview. It also means you can wait for an offer you are satisfied with. \"And you're in a stronger [buying] position with funds being available \u2014 it gives you more negotiating power,\" says Ms Cunningham. You're also avoiding paying two mortgages and associated fees at once, as well as bridging finance. However, if there is a gap between settlement of your current home and the new property you purchase, you may need to find temporary accommodation or move into a rental. \"Not everyone has a mum to go home to,\" says Ms Cunningham. There can be pressure to buy quickly for that reason. Ms Pilkington recommends people talk to their agent about how long similar properties in your area are taking to sell, and see what else is out there. \"Be realistic about the price, and make sure the agent is giving you comparable properties [when considering these factors] \"The more info you have, the more comfortable you can be with your decision.\" Ms Cunningham says people should be talking to a broker before they make any moves to buy or sell because \"you don't know what you don't know\".

        "raw_text": "Lili Greer remembers a feeling of constant dread during her childhood. \"I was constantly worried for my mum's safety,\" the 27-year-old from Sydney/Gadigal Country says. Lili and her mum Tina were victims of domestic and family violence, perpetrated by Tina's boyfriend. As a child, Lili was exposed to many violent incidents directed mostly towards her mum, and says she felt helpless to stop it. When Lili was 13, her mum went missing. Lili says mum Tina was her best friend.(Supplied) An inquest held in 2023, which Lili advocated for, found Tina was murdered \"most likely violently\" by her now-dead boyfriend. \"My whole world fell apart \u2026 Mum was my person, and I was her person. She was my best friend. \"I was concerned about my safety [after Mum went missing]; is this man coming for me? I still have significant issues sleeping from the after-effects of him stalking us.\" While Lili says her experience with violence and loss will have lifelong impacts, advocating for change has been part of her healing. Sneha Sapkota is program coordinator for Engender Equality's Advocates for Change and says advocacy is a chance for victim-survivors to rebuild community and reclaim their voice. \"When you step into advocacy spaces, you get to experience allyship \u2026 you get to celebrate strength and resilience.\" The Australian Child Maltreatment Studypublished in 2023found 39.6 per cent of children under 18 have been exposed to domestic violence. A third of those reported being exposed to more than 50 incidents. Tania Farha, CEO of Safe and Equal, says the ways in which children are impacted by domestic and family violence are extensive and profound. \"Exposure to family violence can be damaging to long-term development, physical and mental health, and future relationships,\" she says. Ms Farha says meeting developmental milestones, and a secure attachment to caregivers may be disrupted, for example. Experiencing, and being exposed to, violence as a child stays with people into adulthood. \"When you're a kid, and you experience these things, it impacts your basic sense of security,\" Ms Farha says. She says it's \"always in the back of your mind\" that you may not be able to access food or housing security, for example. Lili says advocating for change has helped with her healing.(Supplied: Lili Greer) In 2022, Lili foundedThe Tina Greer Project. She also works for a domestic violence charity and The Missed Foundation, which works to humanise missing persons, and alleviate the profound practical and emotional impacts on their families. Lili says she is passionate about improving the services and resources available to child victim-survivors. \"At the time [of Mum's disappearance], there was no support provided to me. \"I fell through the cracks because she was a missing person.\" Ms Farha says children and young people need tailored support services. \"We really need people to view children and young people as victim-survivors in their own right, with their own unique needs \u2014 and not just extensions of their parents or caregivers. \"What we should be better at doing is making sure we have bespoke responses for children at all ages, that continues over the life course, to make sure they can deal with any post-traumatic issues that emerge. Told they couldn't go out with friends. Stopped from giving male friends a hug. Called crazy and gaslit. They are just some of the early signs of intimate partner violence shared by victim-survivors. \"I don't think we do that as well as we should.\" Lili has written a children's book inspired by her experiences, titled Why Elle Spoke Up. The story is designed to encourage children to speak up if they are living in an unsafe home, and to support educators, counsellors and safe adults in starting difficult but necessary conversations. \"I noticed there is a huge gap in terms of resources available for children, their friends, and just communities in general to have these conversations,\" Lili says. Daniel says he and his brother Luke were his mum Teresa's whole world.(Supplied) Daniel Mancuso's mum Teresa was murdered by her ex-husband, Daniel's father, in 2013. Daniel says he and his brother Luke were exposed to abuse growing up. \"It's sad to say, we just assumed that was normal,\" the 35-year-old from Melbourne/Naarm says. \"My mum was a kind soul. Her life revolved around her two boys. \"She was always the life of the party.\" After their mum's death, Daniel and Luke moved into their grandparents' home, where she had been living.

And more importantly, showcasing the power of kindness and connection, and its role in violence prevention. \"I'm trying to honour my mum's legacy, and give back,\" Daniel says. \"I know that she would have done the same thing for us.\" Daniel says he hopes to reach younger generations and change attitudes, including gender stereotypes. \"My experiences have given me a blueprint of what not to do \u2014 and the man I want to be. \"Men try and be so masculine, but it's good to be vulnerable.\" Advocates are an essential part of working towards ending gender-based violence, says Sneha Sapkota. Daniel, pictured with his wife, says his experiences have shaped his willingness to be open and vulnerable in relationships.(Supplied) \"We cannot have sustainable change without including lived experience.\" And while it's hard work, she says most advocates believe it's worthwhile. \"There is fatigue. Changing systems take a long time, and there is a lot of push back, but there is so much healing.\" Lili says she her mum's fiercely protective nature and resolve to never back down encourages her to keep going. \"Mum was a really tough lady. \"Even though we did escape, unfortunately there was no support externally to help her. She was carrying so much. \"I credit all of my life to her in terms of my personality and my work.\"",

After taking a redundancy from the job that \"defined her\", Sandy came across a Facebook ad looking for drivers \u2014 for pets. The 58-year-old now works for a pet-sitting service, transporting animals between their homes and their sitters around Sydney/Gadigal Country. \"I just potter around in my boss's car, talking nonsense to dogs and cats all day \u2026 Everyone is much more envious of that than when I was a flight attendant.\" We spoke to Sandy about her career switch, which also included a stint in retail and bartending on a vintage train. These are her words. Sandy was employed by Qantas for three decades.(Supplied) I started [as a flight attendant] in 1992 when Qantas was recruiting for Japanese speakers. That's something I did at high school and in university. It was the peak of Japanese tourism in Australia. I started off as a flight attendant and made my way through the ranks to supervisor and eventually cabin manager. The best thing was we had lots of long trips and long time in various ports. But once Qantas was sold and they started to cut costs, they started making trips shorter. We called them slam-clickers \u2014 where you get off the flight, go to your hotel room, and only leave to come out for work. Leaving my day job was the only way to circuit break my life back into balance. Six months later, life is very different. What kept me there was the fun and the great people I worked with. We had a laugh every single day. And the cheap travel. I was working in short-haul domestic flights for three years of COVID. It was all about the handwashing and the masks and people getting edgy on flights. They offered a redundancy, and I thought \"the writing's on the wall now \u2014 get out while they're offering money to do so\". I wasn't one of those people who were very upset to leave, or felt forced out. It was time. One of the first things I did was get a pet, then the second was book subscriptions, because I knew I was going to be home for shows, the theatre, birthdays. That was the first Christmas I knew I would be home in 30 years, and I got to spend it with my sister and her husband, and my beautiful 19-year-old niece. Sandy says working with animals is rewarding.(Supplied) I had a good payout from Qantas, so had the financial stability to experiment with work a bit. I own my home. I don't have dependants, just the cats. I decided I needed to do something to get out of my house because it was [during] COVID, and a lot of retail was considered essential work. I worked in a homewares store, which was considered a vital industry. I don't know why, I guess people need sheets and towels! I found that very different to the airline. People really didn't treat you well in retail, even though it was a lovely shop. People were quite respectful to flight attendants. You had the odd drongo, but [most passengers] knew you were there doing a hard job, looking after their safety. Do you have a unique job you often get questions about? We'd love to hear about itlifestyle@abc.net.au After a couple of years in retail, I was offered work on a vintage train. It was the old Southern Aurora, a stainless-steel diesel from 1962. The owners knew someone from Qantas and he recruited his friends to work on it \u2014 it was taken over by Qantas people. The owners of the train were delighted because they had this pre-trained \u2026 workforce. We all knew the way each other worked, and how to move around each other in confined spaces. I was the bartender. I absolutely loved it and would be doing it now if it didn't change hands. Sandy says people are envious of her pet-transport gig.(Supplied) For the pet-sitting company, I pick up the pets from the owners and take them to the pet sitter's home with their belongings. And reverse when the owners get back from holiday. After 30 years of working with people, it's really nice to have customers that can't talk. I've lived in Sydney all my life, so I'm not daunted by traffic or parking. You have some hysterical moments. I have this golden retriever who gets car sick ... Throws up, tries to eat it, and then sits in it. Then I have a Maine coon [cat] who lives in the poshest house imaginable and gets sent to quite a small apartment. He yells at me the whole way. People comment about how wonderful it must be. I say, 'It's not well paid, but it's hugely emotionally rewarding'. I just love animals. I get so much out of it when I see the dogs reunited with their owners.",

Ms Wong says income generated from side-hustles has become a major focus for the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), with digital service platforms such as YouTube and OnlyFans now legally required to report the income earned by their users. \"[Sometimes content creators] think it's a hobby and they don't need to declare \u2026 but if there is some regular activity or potential of making profit, then in most cases, generally the ATO will see that as income.\" The tax implications of earning money from content creation, including content created as an influencer on social media platforms, is \"the same as for anyone else\", an ATO spokesperson says. \"Income earned is taxable, regardless of the form in which it is given to you.\" If you are paid with goods or other benefits, for example being able to keep an outfit used in a post, or being \"gifted\" something, that is classed as a \"bartering transaction\". And that is subject to the same income tax and GST treatment as normal cash or credit payments, the spokesperson says. If an influencer is earning money through continuous and repeated activities for the purpose of making a profit, then it's likely they arerunning a business, according to the ATO. \"If so, they will need to register for GST and lodge a business activity statement if they exceed or expected to meet the GST turnover threshold of $75,000 per annum,\" the spokesperson says. Influencing would not be considered a business if it was a one-off transaction, or a hobby, or recreation in which you don't seek to profit, for example. If an influencer or content creator is paid with goods or other benefits, for example being \"gifted\" something, that is classed as a \"bartering transaction\".(Pexels) Queenie, who has 450,000 followers across her social platforms, is now a full-time content creator. And she has become much better at knowing what she can claim. Because she makes video content, Queenie has claimed camera equipment, microphones and lighting equipment on her tax. The ATO says to be able to claim a deduction for an expense you must spend the money yourself and not get a reimbursement, the expense mustdirectly relate to earning your income, and you must have arecordto prove it (usually a receipt). \"You can only claim GST credits for the GST included in the price of any goods and services acquired for business purposes,\" a spokesperson says. Tune in this Sunday at 7.30pm on ABC TV or on ABC iview. Queenie says she stays on top of her tax by keeping things separate to her everyday spending. \"Now I use [an app] which just makes it so much easier. It connects to all your bank accounts, and now I have a separate credit card just for business purposes.\" The ATO spokesperson says it is important to maintain accurate records. \"We have sophisticated data-matching and analytical tools that enable us to identify under-reporting of income or not being registered for GST when required to be. \"Where we identify people that have made a genuine mistake, we will support them in understanding the law and getting back on track.\" If in doubt, Ms Wong recommends people see a registered tax accountant. \"Don't risk it.\" This article contains general information only.

        "raw_text": "Have you considered replacing your plastic spatula after seeing a much-shared study that found black plastic kitchen utensils were unsafe? The study was corrected in early 2025due to a major miscalculation that impacted the results. So what should you be looking out for when choosing or replacing cooking utensils at home and weighing up their functionality, durability and your health? Fiona Mair recommends checking cooking utensils and gadgets are comfortable to hold.(Supplied: Choice) Fiona Mair, a home economist and kitchen expert with consumer group Choice, says it's important to think about your kitchen as a whole before you buy something new or rush to replace an item. \"Think about what you're cooking at home and what cookware you have,\" she says. For instance, \"if you have a lot of non-stick cookware, then you're not going to want to buy stainless steel [utensils] because it's just going to scratch\". Space is precious in most kitchens and she recommendslooking for versatile utensilsto reduce your spending. She also says price does not necessarily equate to quality. The best vegetable peeler she has found comes from the supermarket. The chef and owner of Indian restaurant Enter Via Laundry in Naarm/Melbourne, Helly Raichura, says she opts formetal spoons, whisks and spatulas. Unlike with plastic alternatives, she says there'sno risk of stainless steel tools accidentally melting in a busy kitchen. Raichura says some types of stainless steel will last forever and others will turn grey and show signs of wear and tear over time. It can be helpful to keep note of what grade of stainless steel you're using, she says. Helly Raichura recommends doing a little bit of research before making any purchases, saying it will \"pay off later down the track\".(ABC Radio National: Damien Peck) Ms Mair says she's had some wooden spoons for more than 20 years. They're veryversatile, durable and can be kinder on the surfaces of your cookware, she says. Ms Mair says they need to behandwashed well in hot, soapy water and then dried completely, and there are alsoproducts to help prolong the life of wooden items. For example, food-grade beeswax can be rubbed into the wood to help it last longer. Wooden spoons are also a staple in Ms Raichura's utensil drawer, but \"don't put them in the dishwasher,\" she urges. This can cause them todry out, warp, crack and for splinters to form. Oliver Jones, a professor of chemistry at RMIT in Naarm/Melbourne, sayscookware and kitchen utensils sold in Australia are \"quite strictly regulated\", with manufacturers required to demonstrate they're safe. Chemosphere \u2013 a peer-reviewed scientific journal \u2013 was forced to issue a correction after scientists made a major error calculating the toxicity of black plastic kitchen utensils. Professor Jones says the quality will vary among plastic and silicone cooking utensils, and more expensive products can often withstand higher temperatures. \"Usually, [plastic utensils are] designed for particular use and they're very safe for that use.\" If you have a damaged plastic utensil, Professor Jones says to replace it if you want to. \"If you're not comfortable it's probably safer to get a new one, but it's not actually a very high risk,\" he says. Professor Jones also says: \"There's a lot of concern about microplastics. A lot of it, I think, is not data driven \u2026 but that's not to negate the real concerns that people have about it.\" He says microplastics are usually produced \"when you get something grinding against something else\". Something like a plastic salt grinder is likely to create some microplastics, he says, but \"you wouldn't be rubbing two [plastic] ladles together, for example\". For anyone who prefers to do their washing up with the help of a dishwasher, Ms Mair has this advice. Tune in this Sunday at 7.30pm on ABC TV or on ABC iview. While the manufacturers of some stainless steel and plastic products will mark products as dishwasher friendly, she says theymay \"deteriorate over time and become brittle depending on the type of material that's used\". Look for things that seem hardy and well made,paying special attention to handles, if you're a dishwasher devotee, she says. If you can, Ms Raichura suggests looking at what's on offer inhospitality stockists, especially if durability and quality are priorities. \"They almost always havea retail outlet open for everyone,\" she says. She also recommendsvisiting Asian or Indian specialty storesfor a variety of kitchen tools. You can find better quality items at a lower price point, she says.",

        "raw_text": "Lauren Black was 35 and raising a toddler when her mum died unexpectedly. \"Mum was the centre pin for so many people in my family, and the family business, and suddenly that fell to myself and my older brother,\" says the 42-year-old from Albury-Wodonga, on the traditional lands of the Wiradjuri people. \"I stepped into Mum's place for my dad, took over the care of their two dogs as well as my own, stepped in as my grandmother's support with the onset of dementia, and stepped in to work with my brother as he took over the family business.\" Lauren says the sudden change and increased responsibility, which included moving back to her hometown from city life in Canberra, was a strain on her marriage. \"My husband got the last of my time and our relationship suffered.\" Lauren wrote to us after reading our storyon being the sandwich generation. We spoke to Lauren to hear more about how caring for a young child and older family members affected her marriage, and also asked two experts for their insights into the toll being in the sandwich generation can have on relationships. The mental load of juggling three young kids, while running a household with a husband who works long hours, and now caring for her mum with dementia, is \"relentless\", says Bec Nolan. Michelle O'Shea is a senior lecturer in the School of Business at Western Sydney University and has been analysing data on sandwich carers, provided by Carers NSW. \"What really resonated was the cognitive load. Respondents consistently talked about this idea of care taking up such a large part of their time and mental energy,\" Dr O'Shea says. She says there was also a physical toll that left carers exhausted. \"[One woman spoke about] having to render assistance to her mother, which included bathing and assisting around the house, while also doing those things in her household as well.\" The mental and physical load means there is often nothing left to give anyone else in their lives, Dr O'Shea says, including quality time with a partner. Lauren says moving back to her hometown on a whim to help family was part of the struggle, because her husband Matt didn't have the same social network in the area. \"I was his person in Albury, but I wasn't available. \"We didn't have any time together, and any time I did have, I needed to look after myself. \"Matt and I have always so had different interests, so he's not coming to a ceramics workshop, where I want to sit down and chat to other women who are going through the same thing as me.\" The couple also missed out on creating the family they had imagined for themselves. Being a part of the sandwich generation is one of the most intense life stages many couples face, says Queenie Wu, a clinical psychologist in Brisbane/Meanjin. She says many couples may experience communication breakdown, resentment over an unequal responsibility, and financial pressures. \"Clients talk about going from lovers to logistic managers without realising it.\" Couples who cope well with being in the sandwich generation regularly check in and prioritise time together, experts say.(Pexels) This can be impacted further when the aging parent lives in the home. \"Even with love and goodwill, it shifts the emotional centre of the home,\" Dr Wu says. \"Couples' connection can take a big hit \u2026 there can be a grief and loss of privacy and that safe haven.\" She says parents living in the home can also create confusion around roles. \"Sometimes parents overstep and undermine.\" Lauren says the bulk of the caring duties fell to her. \"It's a gendered issue \u2026 but Matt was also struggling a lot. \"While I was drowning in responsibility, I had so many women around me going through the same thing, so I was able to connect and get that support. \"Whereas Matt focused on his work and playing sport, where there isn't always the opportunity to discuss your struggles.\" The aged care sector is set for change after bipartisan agreement on a new fee structure, but where does it leave those Australians in an informal caring role? Dr O'Shea says even when there might be multiple adult children in the family, most of the time caring duties rest with the daughter or daughter-in-law. \"There were lots of women speaking [about] the care of their own parents, but also their in-laws. \"And what's different about women in this sandwich generation to prior generations, is not only are these women caring for their children and elder relatives, but they're also working.\" And while it might be more common or expected in certain cultures to take care of aging parents, it's often no less difficult, says Dr Wu. \"For many Chinese Australians like me, it's not just an expectation [to care for aging parents], but a fundamental responsibility ingrained from childhood. \"Cultural values may shape the stories, but the stress is still real.\" Dr O'Shea says many migrant families in Australia may also be dealing with supporting family from afar. \"They also have care commitments for aging relatives living abroad. \"There is another layer to that care.\" Many carers don't feel seen in the work they are doing. \"It's invisible,\" says Dr Wu. For that reason, she says it's important couples acknowledge and validate the care that is being undertaken. To stay connected, couples should prioritise time together like they would \"a medical appointment\", she says. \"We need to make it happen \u2014 treat it as sacred.\" Ongoing communication and regular check-ins are also essential, says Dr Wu. \"Couples who come through this chapter stronger are those who stay intentional. \"They talk openly, share the load fairly, protect small moments of connection, and see themselves as a team. \"Even amidst the chaos, they choose each other, again and again.\" Lauren says life is slowly becoming more manageable. For example, her career is \"back on track\", her dad has a new partner, and her brother runs the family business independently. But she says it will take time to fully recover. \u201cI still feel like we are living through the most hectic times in our lives and haven\u2019t had a chance to catch our breath.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "If you believe the ads and social media posts, starting your day with a green powder or greens supplement will help your health and wellbeing. Often shown as part of a picture-perfect morning routine, they might seem like the answer to lacklustre veggie consumption. But, are they actually worth taking? And are there any downsides to them? Here's what a dietician and a nutritionist say. Emma Beckett says our diets don't always have to be perfect, convenience is a factor too.(Supplied: Emma Beckett) There is ahuge varietyof green powders available \u2014 and a big variation in prices. 100 grams of green powder can cost $12 at the supermarket or about $45 at a beauty and skincare store. Some products spruik that they help you meet your daily intake of healthy greens, that they're a fibre source to help keep you regular, and terms like superfood and super greens also come up. Food and nutrition scientist Emma Beckett, based in Newcastle/Awabakal, says these types of products have become more prominent andthere's a lot of variation between products and the way they're marketed. Dr Beckett thinksconvenienceis part of what makes green powders attractive. There's also a marketing element, she says, with labels spruiking health claims and benefits. \"You can't do that with fresh wholefoods, there's nowhere to put a label on an actual bunch of broccoli or a cup of brussels sprouts.\" Green powders aren't necessary, according to Stephanie Partridge, an accredited practising dietician and associate professor at the University of Sydney, on Gadigal land. \"My first impression when I see these kind of products is thinking this is just another thing that we don't need,\" she says. Dr Partridge saysgreen powders usually contain some vitamins and minerals and a little fibre, \"but it doesn't replace a healthy balanced diet\". \"If you can have a healthy meal, you'll likely get all of the vitamins and minerals that you would from a powder, and then if you repeat that across the day and you'll also be satiated for longer.\" Green powders are generallymade with freeze-dried fruits and vegetables, but Dr Patridge sayswhen they are processed and broken down, some of their benefits are lost. While a green powder may offer a couple of grams of fibre per serving, she says an apple or pear instead could make up 6 grams (therecommended daily intakefor adults is 25 to 30 grams). Because these powders are \"refined and processed plant matter\", Dr Beckett saysit's hard to say whether they count towards thefive serves of veggiesa daytarget. \"People are probably buying these thinking a scoop is equivalent to a veggie and it definitely is not.\" But, she says they are also \"a tool that's better than no vegetables\u201d and our diets don\u2019t have to be perfect. Stephanie Partridge says green powders are a potential \"money waster\".(Supplied: Stephanie Partridge) Dr Beckett suggests it's helpful to think of these supplements as an addition rather than a replacement for anything. People share a lot of their lives on social media. This can even include digestion details, with content about \"staying regular\", bloating and fibre far from off-limits. She says theycould be useful for people with a low appetite, a very restrictive diet or for those who are travelling. For those not eating vegetables to start with, Dr Beckett says adding a powder could be beneficial. If choosing between products, Dr Beckett says to\"look for the majority ingredient being actual vegetable powder, with actual recognisable vegetables listed\". Green powders can also \"have quite strong flavours\", so if you are trying to \"hide\" veggies in food using these supplements could change the flavour, Dr Beckett says. Dr Partridge says green powders could help people incorporate or improve their intake of vitamins and minerals, but they're \"ideally used under professional guidance\". Some vitamins and minerals can interact with medications, \"particularly fat-soluble vitamins that can be stored in our liver might have interactions with some medications.\"She also recommendsconsulting a GP or healthcare professional if you\u2019re planning a pregnancy, pregnant or breastfeedingand considering introducing a greens powder \u2014 or giving it to your child. Dr Beckett says \"allergens are another reason to look at the labels\" especially if you have allergies. She sayspotential risks include soy, gluten, fish and shellfish. Dr Partridge says green powders sold and purchased in Australia reputably are regulated byTherapeutic Goods Administrationas either food or medicine. \"That said, there is always some potential risk of contamination, especially for products purchased online from unverified sources or from overseas.\" Dr Beckett says while these powders are convenient and have some benefits, they're not going to help you feel full and satisfied like a vegetable. \"Tryeating vegetables in the way that you'd like themrather than eating them in the perfect form,\" she recommends. Tune in this Sunday at 7.30pm on ABC TV or on ABC iview. She also suggestspureeing or mashing vegetables and incorporating them into a dishthat way if you're trying to \"hide\" them. Dr Beckett's favourite tip isadding extra veggies to something you already cookand enjoy. \"Take the bolognese you're already making and add some carrot, or take the tacos you're already making and grate in some mushrooms.\" Dr Partridge says if you're time poor and need something you can consume quickly,a smoothie could be a good alternative. \"You can easily add a good handful of spinach\", along with other fruits and vegetables you might prefer the taste of, she says.

        "raw_text": "As large parts of the country shiver through winter, making sure our loved ones are rugged up in their warmest clothes is a top priority. And for many of us, that includes our four-legged family members. Butdoes your dog actually need to wear a jacket? According to experts, that depends on a variety of factors, including their size, breed and how cold it gets where you live. One of the main determining factors forwhether your dog needs a jacket is how small they are, according to Susan Hazel, an associate professor from the University of Adelaide who specialises in research into animal welfare, behaviour and ethics. Dr Hazel saysdogs that are less than 10 kilograms\"and ones that areless than 5kg, even more so\" are likely to benefit from wearing a jacket when it is cold,particularly if they are venturing outdoors. Owners of dogs that weigh less than 5kg should consider putting jackets on them if they are venturing outdoors in cold weather.(Adobe Stock) \"Smaller dogs, because their body surface area to body mass has a different ratio, theywill get cold,\" Dr Hazel says. Breeds including Italian greyhounds, French bulldogs, chihuahuas, toy poodles, pugs, Maltese and Yorkshire terriersare among those that can benefit from wearing a coat in colder weather. Shaun Naylor and his husband Benny Cole live on the Gold Coast, on the traditional lands of the Yugambeh people, and have recently welcomed Louis, a four-month-old Italian greyhound, into their family. Shaun said it quickly became clear that Louis \"definitely needs a jacket\" when it's cold. Louis on a morning constitutional in one of his knitted jumpers.(Supplied: Shaun Naylor) \"He gets really, really cold as soon as the temperature drops,\" he says. \"He might be sitting with us on a couch with a blanket and you might move the blanket and there's a breeze and he just starts to shiver. \"We'll get up in the morning and take him out to the garden so he can go to the toilet, and as soon as you pick him up and move him away from the heater or anything, his whole body shakes. \"We have had him less than two weeks and he currently has three knitted jumpers, one hoodie, a reflective woolly coat for when he goes walking and some pyjamas.\" Larger dog breeds \u2014particularly those with double coatssuch as golden retrievers, labradors, huskies, German shepherds, border collies and Newfoundlands \u2014 are more easilyable to regulate their body heat, even if they are out walking in cold or wet weather. \"They really are wearing a heavy fur coat and even when it rains, the rain doesn't tend to get through that double layer,\" Dr Hazel says. However, some larger breeds with single coats or shorter hair, such as greyhounds, have low body fat, which means they don't have much insulation from the cold. \"If your dog gets cold, it will shiver in the same way that we doif we get really cold, so people will know if their greyhounds are a bit cold,\" Dr Hazel says. If your dog is sleeping inside, there's generallyno need to dress them in jackets or pyjamas overnight, provided they have warm bedding. Dr Hazel says there are more important considerations than a jacketif your dog sleeps outdoors at night, including akennel that is protected from wind and rain. She says it's important they have \"somewhere they can keep warm and [have] some bedding\" and \"not just a bit of concrete\". \"The smaller the dog, the more important that would be, and the colder the area, the more important that would be.\" Shaun also owns a Maltese\u2013chihuahua cross named Dylan, and says he has \"lots of fur, so I guess it's a little bit more for the people than for him when you put him in clothes\". \"But he does like to have a jacket when it's cold \u2026 he'll come to you and let you know he wants his jacket.\" When it comes to staying warm in winter, many of you are making sure your dogs are rugged up. But not all pets enjoy the extra layer. Dr Hazel says, \"dogs are people pleasers\" and \"if the dog tolerates it \u2026 [and] you're not using aversive methods\",there is generally no harm dressing them in clothes. \"You get the full range with dogs, with some of them that love wearing a coat, some of them that are ambivalent but put up with it and some that hate it.\" She says she would \"never, ever recommend trying to force a jacket on a dog that didn't like it\" and \"if you did that, every time you did it, it's going to get harder and harder\". Owners should alsomake sure any jackets or jumpers fit their dogs properlyand regularly check that there are no ill-fitting straps, Velcro or other material that is rubbing on their skin and causing pain or discomfort. Mount Gambiervet Teresa Priddle recently told the ABCthat jacketsshould always be taken on and off every dayand it was worth \"checking daily that it's fitting correctly and there are no rub marks\".",

Among those advocating against the proposal is former ANU music student Donna Parkes, who is now a professional musician.",
        "raw_text": "Since she was little, Canberra-raised and internationally renowned trombonist Donna Parkes wanted to be a musician. She was identified early on as having what it took to be among the best, and started studying at the Australian National University (ANU) from a young age. \"I was incredibly lucky to start at the School of Music as a scholarship student at the age of 12,\" she said. Donna Parkes became a successful trombone player after starting her career at the ANU School of Music.(ABC News: Adam Shirley) Parkes rose through the ranks and benefited from what she describes as a \"world-class staff and faculty\" at the school, and as a teenager began performing with the Canberra Symphony Orchestra (CSO). Parkes left Australia to fulfil her orchestral career and played across the world with renowned symphony orchestras. Decades on, she has returned to Canberra to teach and mentor the next generation of musical performers, and now works for the CSO. The Canberra Symphony Orchestra draws many of its musicians from the ANU School of Music.(Supplied: Martin Ullman) But the next generation faces an uncertain future in the capital region. That is becausethe ANU is proposing to absorb the School of Music into a single course, as part of a suite of planned changes to arts, sciences and humanities at the university. If the changes are confirmed, the specialist performance and composition teaching the School of Music is renowned for will be discontinued. It has prompted the CSO to write directly to the ANU's leadership and make a submission to the consultation phase of the draft changes. Rachel Thomas is the chief executive of the CSO and she is adamant that the draft changes to the School of Music \"present a serious risk to the arts ecosystem, musical training pipeline and professional performance in Canberra\". \"It's been a symbiotic relationship where we have seen students and teachers performing in the orchestra, and that really has been magical from that perspective,\" Ms Thomas said. Rachel Thomas has made a bid to save the School of Music from being absorbed into another department.(ABC News: Adam Shirley) She says that the CSO wants to collaborate with the ANU and help find a solution, not simply criticise. Ms Thomas worries that if the proposed changes from the ANU are realised, there will be broader consequences for how everyone enjoys art in Canberra. \"We encounter all art forms in many different aspects of our daily life, I think without even realising what joy it brings to us,\" she said. \"Ultimately, if you have less professional musicians playing \u2026 the vibrancy of the orchestra diminishes, you attract less musicians to the city, you attract less students to the city.\" Donna Parkes wants to ensure future music students have the same opportunities as her.(ABC News: Adam Shirley) The ANU was not available for an interview about the CSO's concerns and ideas for the School of Music. In a statement, the Dean of the ANU College of Arts and Social Sciences, Bronwyn Parry, said the University's \"commitment to Canberra's cultural life remains strong and will continue\". \"Music is not under threat, we are investing in its future through a revitalised structure and a renewed curriculum that reflects more than two years of planning, research and consultation,\" Professor Parry said. Trombonist Donna Parkes is \"100 per cent optimistic\" that specialist music teaching can be retained at the School of Music. Ultimately, it is the ANU that will make the final decision about what the next generation receives.",

        "raw_text": "Protest songs have a powerful way of demanding our attention. A new song titled Karrinjala Muajarri Mi, by Warlpiri elder Ned Jampijinpa Hargraves and Red Dirt Blues, does just that. The title of the song is its haunting refrain, which Mr Hargraves explains means \"ceasefire\". \"That is so, so extremely important to our young generations today, to understand it and be able to be proud of what's in that song,\" Mr Hargraves says. It is the context of the track, described as a song from the remote community of Yuendumu, that makes it so poignant. Ned Jampijinpa Hargraves is using music to spread his message.(ABC Alice Springs: Elsie Lange) WARNING: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that this article contains the names of Indigenous people who have died. Mr Hargraves's voice has been one of the loudest advocating against the use of police guns in Aboriginal communities after the killing of Kumanjayi Walker in Yuendumu by police officer Zachary Rolfe in 2019. In 2022, after Mr Rolfe was found not guilty of all charges related to the killing, Mr Hargraves looked into cameras and cried\"karrinjala muajarri mi, no guns \u2026 we don't want no guns, enough is enough\". This month, when Northern Territory Coroner Elisabeth Armitage delivered her findings in the long-running inquest into Kumunjayi Walker's death, Mr Hargraves told reporters that\"we need to let the world know what has been happening to us\". In May this year, Kumanjayi White, also from Yuendumu, died in police custody. He was Mr Hargraves's grandson. The family is stillcalling for an independent investigation into his death. The opening line of the new track, which is set to be released in August, declares \"jails are full of our children\" and is inspired by the elder's disappointment in the criminal justice system. Ned Jampijinpa Hargraves collaborated with Julien Poulson of Red Dirt Blues on the track.(ABC Alice Springs: Xavier Martin) Julien Poulson,from the band Red Dirt Blues, says that when he first heard these lines from Mr Hargraves, he knew they had to be turned into music to spread the message. They collaborated on the track during a workshop in Alice Springs. \"I was calling together songwriters and only a few people turned up, but the ones that did are giants,\" he says. Mr Poulson then reached out to Berlin artist Professor Kinski to produce the song, which uniquely blends desert rock with electronica. Mr Hargraves says it is significant that the song's powerful message is delivered in Warlpiri. \"The most important thing that happens today is using strong Warlpiri, strong words that have been used in the past, like the old people used it, because they needed to maintain the language,\" he says. Tommy Gunn Hargraves hopes the message of the song resonates with people.(ABC Alice Springs: Elsie Lange) The track also features a rap from Mr Hargraves's grandson, Tommy Hargraves, whose stage name is Tommy Gunn. His lyrics are as stark as they are striking, with lines including: \"They killing my people, they putting my children in prison, lock 'em up without question, they find us guilty for having black skin.\" He says his words for the song came naturally after his grandfather sent him an early version, as though they were just waiting to be written. \"I hope this song achieves the listeners, because this song is a message, and I hope that people listen to the struggles of my people,\" the young rapper says. \"I hope this song touches people.\" The elder Mr Hargraves says he wants his protest song to deliver a strong message. \"It's clear: ceasefire,\" he says.",

        "summary": "the 1987 single has been crowned the people's favourite . it surpasses classics by Hilltop Hoods, Missy Higgins, Crowded House and Cold Chisel .",
        "raw_text": "An uncharacteristic ballad from one of Australia's biggest, best-selling rock bands, INXS's 'Never Tear Us Apart' long ago transcended its origins to become a bona fide anthem. But is it the best Australian song of all time? Yes, according to the 2.65 million votes inthe Hottest 100 of Australian Songs. The nation has spoken, and the 1987 single has been crowned the people's favourite, surpassing classics by Hilltop Hoods, Missy Higgins, Crowded House, Cold Chisel and many more in the special edition of triple j's national music poll. INXS, a beloved global sensation with more than 70 million records and 4 billion streams to their name, were always going to be a frontrunner in the countdown. Double J chronicles one of Australia's most significant bands. The group's greatest hits compilation, The Very Best, is currently number two on theARIA Australian Album Charts, and it's held a spot in the Top 20 for a whopping 12 years. Formed in 1977, INXS toured relentlessly, sculpted by Sydney's pub rock scene. They grew into an excellent singles band who, beginning with 1983's Nile Rodgers-produced 'Original Sin', began competing \u2014 then dominating \u2014 on an international level. Fronted by the enigmatic Michael Hutchence, INXS reached their commercial and creative peak with breakthrough sixth album, Kick. Released 19 October 1987, Kick was a blockbuster that cemented the six-piece in the coveted American market, despite the band's label initially hating the record. Kick sealed the smash success INXS had promised to become ever since their third album, 1982\u2019s Shabooh Shoobah.(Supplied: Universal Music Group) Atlantic Records didn't grasp the sleek fusion of pop, rock and funk, fearing Kick would alienate rock radio and fail to compete with that year's chartbusters: Michael Jackson's Bad, U2's The Joshua Tree, and hair metallers Guns N' Roses, Def Leppard and Whitesnake. Long-time INXS manager Chris Murphy said Atlantic offered him a million dollars to re-record the album. He rejected and his and the band's instincts were vindicated. Kick peaked at #3 on the US Billboard 200 (behind George Michael's Faith and the Dirty Dancing soundtrack) and reached #2 in Australia (kept from the top spot by Icehouse's Man of Colours). Its success extended to being the best-selling album in Australia of 1988, eventually going seven times Platinum at home. In America, it shifted a staggering six million units (six times Platinum) and produced four top 10 hits: 'New Sensation', 'Devil Inside', 'Need You Tonight' (the band's first and only US number one, and #59 in the Hottest 100 of Australian Songs), and 'Never Tear Us Apart'. Courtney Barnett shares her memories and top 10 picks for the Hottest 100 of Australian Songs. Courtney Barnett was one of several Australian musicians whovoted for 'Never Tear Us Apart'in the Hottest 100 of Australian songs, alongsideG Flip,R\u00fcf\u00fcs Du Sol, andThe Veronicas. Kick came out the year she was born. \"I was obsessed with the whole album,\" says Barnett, whocovered Kick in its entirety in late 2012, for Melbourne-based Pure Pop Records, with naught but voice and guitar. \"So many great songs, but I think ['Never Tear Us Apart'] is so epic and dramatic and a great love song. I think that makes it feel really timeless.\" Among Kick's muscular grooves and arena-ready sing-alongs, 'Never Tear Us Apart' is the power ballad, with the emphasis on power. But it began life as an even stranger outlier in the band's catalogue: a swaggering, up-tempo number in the vein of old-fashioned rockabilly sensation Gene Vincent. \"I wanted to do something that was very different from what we were doing before,\" keyboardist-guitarist and songwriter Andrew Farriss said in a 2024'Behind The Scenes' video. \"In fact, when Michael first heard what I was doing, he laughed \u2026 I don't think he took it all that seriously.\" But the frontman took Farriss's cassette demo and grew to love what he was hearing. In a break between touring and back in Australia, \"he came around to my little apartment,\" says Farriss, who had transposed the music to piano. \"[Michael] put the lyrics on it [and] worked out the melody, which I think is fantastic; the way it's really understated.\" Even so, when the band got into the studio to record Kick, Farriss was still unsure if the ballad was going to make the cut. British producer Chris Thomas was adamant it had to be on the record,remembers Farriss. \"But I think he was uncomfortable with an electric or acoustic guitar, or even piano, playing like that\u2026 He said, 'have you got a string sample or something?'.\" Farriss did: the Emulator II Marcato strings, a keyboard preset made ubiquitous in the 1980s via songs byMadonna,The Smiths,The Cureand more. Hutchence was already an iconic 1980s sex symbol, but 'Never Tear Us Apart' works so well because he plays to his tender side. He isn't the smouldering rock star, he's the wounded lover, bringing necessary levels of drama in a career-best vocal performance. This is a man you believe could make wine from your tears. And he conveys that sense of tortured romance \u2014 the melancholy, and the triumph \u2014 in just two short verses and a chorus. \"He had the ability to say a lot in a very short space of time,\" says Farriss. \"And I think that communication is evident in 'Never Tear Us Apart'. It goes straight to people's hearts. They want to own it.\" INXS in 1998 (from left) Tim Farriss, Kirk Pengilly, Garry Beers, Michael Hutchence, Andrew Farriss and Jon Farriss.(Supplied: INXS) Ambling at a steady 97 beats per minute in the uber-common key of C Major, 'Never Tear Us Apart' is in the waltz-like time signature of 6/8, which enhances one of its key features: The dramatic silences. The first (at 48 seconds) leads to the twangy, Spaghetti Western guitar break into the second verse. The second (at 1:49) was used to theatrical effect in concert, where lead guitarist and elder Farriss brother, Tim, would stretch out the silence to whip crowds into a frenzied anticipation. \"He stops it for as long as he likes,\" Hutchence deadpanned ina 1987 interview. \"We can go have drinks and sit down for a while.\" This second break leads into another of the song's distinguishing elements: Kirk Pengilly's saxophone solo. Blustering, borderline-erotic, instantly hummable \u2014 it lasts only five bars but provides an added climax to the song. Live, Pengilly would often \"wander off into the audience and find a spot to do the sax solo,\" Hutchence recalled. \"And we never see him again.\" Hutchence experienced plenty of high-profile romances in his life, including Kylie Minogue, Danish supermodel Helena Christensen, and TV presenter/wife of Live Aid organiser Bob Geldof, Paula Yates, among them. But the lyrical inspiration for 'Never Tear Us Apart' was actually Michele Bennett, his pre-fame girlfriend who \u2014 even after splitting in 1987 \u2014 remained Hutchence's dear friend and confidante during the height of his fame. She also introduced Hutchence to filmmaker Richard Lowenstein, who cast the frontman in his 1986 cult classic Dogs In Space and became a long-time INXS collaborator, directing 15 of their music videos. That included 'Never Tear Us Apart', shot in Prague during winter, a universe removed from the sunny beaches of Sydney, using the Czechoslovakian capital's architecture and landmarks as a romantic backdrop to their tear-jerker. \"That was shot in the old town centre, it's so beautiful there,\" Hutchence remarked in abehind the scenes videocommemorating the song's 35th anniversary. \"One thing about communism is it's kept most of the buildings intact. It's like a medieval city.\" At the 1989 ARIA Music Awards, 'Never Tear Us Apart' won INXS Best Group and Best Video, and was a staple of MTV overseas, amplifying Michael Hutchence's magnetic star power. \"He was a cross between Mick Jagger and Jim Morrison,\" MTV video jockey Alan Hunter toldBillboard. Famously, Hutchence's career was tragically cut short. Hedied by suicide in 1997, at age 37, at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Sydney's Double Bay while his INXS bandmates were in rehearsals for another tour. The last person to speak to Hutchence alive? His old flame, Michele Bennett, who received a distressing phone call from the troubled frontman and unsuccessfully attempted to meet him at his hotel room. There was no response, so she left a note with reception. Hutchence's body was discovered by a hotel maid the next morning. An accomplished film and TV producer (whose credits include 2000 hit Chopper and music videos for U2, Prince, Silverchair and Foo Fighters), Bennett didn't speak publicly about Hutchence's death until2019 documentary Mystify, directed by mutual friend Lowenstein. Lowenstein first met Hutchence in 1984, making the music video for INXS single \u2018Burn For You\u2019.(Supplied: Madman) The filmmaker often felt that if Hutchence were to ever settle down, it would have been with Bennett. \"I always felt that, after everything, he'd go back and marry Michele and have a baby with her,\" Lowenstein toldThe Independentin 1998. The only INXS song played at Hutchence's funeral, as his casket was carried out of St. Andrew's Cathedral, was 'Never Tear Us Apart', its already emotive words forever given added weight and bittersweet resonance. When triple j's Hottest 100 first shifted to an annual format in 1993, INXS's commercial dominance was beginning to wane, struggling to detach themselves from the 80s, the era that made them icons. As such, INXS have never previously appeared in the annual poll. Some voters in the Hottest 100 of Australian songs may have been aware of this fact, wanting to vindicate one of Australia's all-timers in our country's most famous music poll (similar to The Veronicas anthem 'Untouched', reaching #3, marking their Hottest 100 debut). Then again, the majority of voters probably had no idea INXS have never made the Hottest 100 before. The biggest voting demographic for 'Never Tear Us Apart' were people aged 18 \u2014 29 (42 per cent of the song's vote), but the track's popularity across all age groups is what rocketed it to the top. Where most other songs were only popular with a single demographic, 'Never Tear Us Apart' had cross generational appeal. It had a higher-than-average vote in ballots from people of all ages. For example, it's the only song to feature in the top five of both men under 30 and the #1 song choice for women aged 46 \u2014 55. Mothers and sons love INXS! So, how did a song approaching its 40th anniversary resonate so broadly with people of all ages? Cultural impact and longevity. INXS's catalogue has been a go-to soundtrack choice in plenty of film and TV moments over four decades, from Law & Order SVU and One Tree Hill to the2004 director's cut of cult indie hit Donnie Darko. Most significantly, INXS served as an important story thread in HBO series Euphoria, exploring the 1980s-era adolescence of Cal Jacobs (played by Eric Dane) and his best friend Derek (Henry Eikenberry) in season two. Specifically, 'Never Tear Us Apart' is used in full in a cold open where the pair's friendship blossoms into a queer romantic exploration, a moment that leans into the tender, feminine side Michael Hutchence expressed in the song. Music supervisor Jen Malone used INXS as her \"jumping-off point\" to soundtrack these flashback sequences and introduced younger audiences to legacy artists. The five INXS songs used across Euphoria season two enjoyed a resurgence as the show's young audience discovered, and embraced, their music. Spotify streams of 'Never Tear Us Apart' enjoyed a 22 per cent boost in the month following the series finale. \"I think that Euphoria is an element of music discovery,\" she toldVarietyin 2022. \"And to be able to introduce some of the Gen Z audience to this amazing music is so exciting. More recently, 'Never Tear Us Apart' was featured in the A24 erotic thriller, Babygirl, thanks to INXS fan Nicole Kidman. The song scores a particularly steamy montage between Kidman's powerful CEO Romy and young intern Samuel (Harry Dickinson) in the office. When director Halina Reijn used it early in production, she knew no other song would better suit the scene. \"I call A24 and I'm like, 'We need the rights to this song.',\" Reijn told theReel Blend podcast in 2024. \"[A24] tried it but it was a hard no [from INXS' people]. I didn't sleep for a week. I tried every other song but nothing worked. As is typically the case with any enduring Aussie anthem, 'Never Tear Us Apart' also has a strong sports connection. Just ask any Port Adelaide fan \u2014 it's been the club's unofficial anthem for more than a decade. Pears supporters regularly hold club scarves,emblazoned with the track name, high above their heads as the song rings out across Adelaide Oval; a pre-game traditionthat began in 2014when the team moved its home ground from Alberton Park to Adelaide Oval. When the idea was first pitched, \"I was quite overwhelmed,\" Andrew Farriss toldABC Overnights in 2024. \"What really struck me, firstly, there's no one performing on the oval, it's the audience endearing themselves to [the] song\u2026 and it's gone into Australian culture. That part hit me quite hard\u2026\" The song continues to resonate with audiences new and old alike, and it's been covered countless times by artists from across the musical spectrum. Tom Jones and Natalie Imbruglia performed itas a duet in 1999. English DJ Tall Paul delivered a thumping remix,titled 'Precious Heart', in 2001. The Nationalrecorded a renditionfor an Australian bushfire fundraising compilation in 2020. Closer to home, both Allday and True Live covered 'Never Tear Us Apart' for triple j's Like A Version. Dua Lipa \u2014 whose hit 'Break My Heart'interpolated INXS\u2019s \u2018Need You Tonight\u2019 \u2013performed the song during the Sydney legof her Australian tour earlier this year. First nations pop sensation The Kid LAROI covered the song atthe 2024 NRL Grand Final, surprising the crowd and his own mother. Reflecting on LAROI's performance, Farriss told ABC Overnights: \"One of the most endearing and surprising things of all is that we, INXS, I don't think any of us really imagined that 30 or something years later, we'd even be relevant. \"It just amazes me still, after all these years, that especially the younger generation of people embrace what INXS did at the time.\" \"Only the band members would ever know what it's like to be INXS,\" Jon Farriss told triple j. \"Being on stage, being the only people to actually see what it looks like with all the people's reactions and how beautiful it is.\" But that perspective was so treasured precisely because of the band's audience, across time and around the world. \"Over the years, the songs do take on their own sort of energy and power, which is really bequeathed from the audience, and it's out of our hands. Once we design and record it, it's sort of takes it and the people choose to do what they want with it.\" 'Never Tear Us Apart' is a song that has truly stood the test of time, a testament to a band at the peak of their powers, and the seemingly ageless appeal of their charismatic frontman. \"Michael would be so proud of how much longevity some of the songs we wrote together have really had,\" Andrew Farriss told ABC in 2024. \"I can't believe it.\" Farriss fondly remembers the \"person that I met in high school when we were teenagers. That's the person I often think about. It's not the uber-famous megastar\" who earned the respect and admiration of peers like Tom Jones, Mick Jagger and Bono. \"I don't think of it like that.\" \u201cHe\u2019s not here\u2026 to enjoy a lot of the flow-on, as years have gone on, and I miss him.\u201d Farriss is right. There are millions of memories embedded in just three minutes of music. And you only need scour the comments section of any INXS content to see innumerable fans sharing fuzzy tales of the tune scoring deeply personal moments of triumph and tragedy alike, late-night pub sing-alongs and private revelries. The same could be said for many of the iconic songs in the Hottest 100 of Australian Songs. Just ask anyone that went through the punishing task of culling their shortlists down to just 10 tunes from across Australian music history \u2014 and there's literally tens of thousands of Hottest 100 voters you could quiz. Ultimately, the main takeaway from that difficult task is that it wasn't really about competition, it was about revisiting \u2014 and celebrating \u2014 the vast scope, scale, and quality of music this county has produced. It's about realising 'how bloody great is Australian music!?' INXS sit atop the countdown, but all 100 songs \u2014 and many more that didn't make the cut \u2014 contain countless memories, milestones, and meaning. And nobody could never, ever tear that apart.",

I'm a 12 year old and I knew most of the songs \ud83d\udc74 I sing some of these songs in the car with my parents all the time! -Julian What an awesome celebration of the brilliance of Australian music! Great work TripleJ -Anthea By Dan Condon Well that was the best Hottest 100 I've ever heard, and I started listening to them back in... well let's just say I've heard a few. Thank you so much for joining us, and a special huge thank you to everyone who voted in this countdown. Getting to celebrate Australian music is the best thing about working in the triple j and Double J family and we're so glad you all joined us for this special event. It's triple j's 50th anniversary this year, so stay tuned for lots more celebrations of Australian music in the coming months! Someone just delivered me a tumbler of sparkling wine so I'm going to go and sing Australian songs with my colleagues and we'll probably stay up too late talking about how much we love Australian music. I cannot adequately thank the esteemed Velvet Winter and Alister Newstead for their company and hard work on the blog today. And thanks so much for all your comments. Make sure you join us on Double J for the 200-101 next week! By Velvet Winter We're sticking around for a little longer so keep those reactions coming! Thank you INXS ....love you...Never tear us apart....thank you -Jewels The best! Never Tear Us Apart \ud83d\udc97 -Jo So happy with number 1, what a song! -Phillip We\u2019re all still a bunch of old softies, Go INXS and Never tear us apart\ud83d\ude0d -Kamikaze By Al Newstead The people have spoken and INXS's 1987 single Never Tear Us Apart has been crowned Australia's favourite song in this special edition of triple j's national music poll. So how did a tender ballad approaching its 40th anniversary resonate with so many people? Because it's truly stood the test of time, scoring everything from film and TV, sporting events, and of course, your many memories and milestones. Here's a deep dive on the whole thing, have a read: By Velvet Winter What a song! What a sax solo! What a countdown!! By Dan Condon It took band matesMC Pressure andDJ Debristo convince Hilltop Hoods's member Suffa that they had something special with their biggest song The Nosebleed Section. \"I was thinking it didn't fit in with the other songs,\" Suffa told triple j back in 2012. \"We try to make really cohesive records where every track feels like it comes from the same place and maybe that one stuck out a bit, but it stuck out in a good way.\" The song has appeared in three Hottest 100s before. This is its highest ever placing, beating the #4 placement it got in 2013's Hottest 100 of the Past 20 Years. By Velvet Winter By Dan Condon Wondering how and why The Veronicas's 2007 song Untouched made it so high? Our pal Courtney Fry from triple j has you covered. By Velvet Winter YES, MY BEAUTIFUL BRISBANE GIRLIES!! By Al Newstead Legitimately, the biggest sing-along all day at triple j HQ goes toMissy Higgins' breakout song . People are even doing the piano part! Plus, as Zan Rowe and Lucy Smith pointed out on air,Missy herself was singing along, cat in her lap. The recentARIA Hall of Fame inducteewrote it when she was just 19, regarding the pressures of others trying to push towards a different musical sound and identity. Like 'a triangle trying to squeeze through a circle' as she sings. \"It's a post-it note in my heart to always trust myself,\" she says on-air of her 2004 single. It still resonates all these years later, all across Australia, the perfect introduction to a gifted melodist and eloquent lyricist, who excelled at penning songs that sound familiar, and always hit close to home. By Velvet Winter Where are all the amazing female Australian artists?  Come on Australia, it it all blokes on their guitars? - Jane Here ya go, Jane! One of our finest! By Dan Condon It was voted in at #76 in the 1998 and #50 in the 2009 Hottest 100 of All Time countdowns, now Crowded House land at #5 in today's Hottest 100 of Australian Songs. \"After six months of the first Crowded House record coming out there was still nothing really happening with it, it was kind of a slow bloomer,\" Neil Finn told Double J's Henry Wagons in 2014. \"But Don't Dream It's Over kind of developed a momentum of its own. You had a sense of events unfolding rapidly that you could just hopefully enjoy \u2013 and I mostly did \u2013 but there's suddenly an intense focus of attention on you and a busyness that you have to adapt to. \"You have to be smart enough to enjoy those moments when they happen. A lot of people recoil in horror at the sudden amount of attention and focus on one particular song, which is kind of like having one of your children picked out and feeling a little upset for your others.\" Read all about this incredibleAustralian(fight me)band here: By Velvet Winter By Velvet Winter By Dan Condon Another previous Hottest 100 winner, Powderfinger's 2000 hit My Happiness is beloved by everyone. We asked a bunch of Australian musicians what it is about this song that makes it such a force. Some people say it's the guitar line, some say it's the sentiment, and some just really love the slinky in the film clip. By Velvet Winter Brb, crying my little eyes out. By Dan Condon Flame Trees is the best song about going back to your old hometown. If you\u2019ve ever done that then this just hits. Shoutout to anyone in Grafton listening to this. Especially if you ever knew Don Walker. This is the only back-to-back of the countdown and if you didn't hear Jimmy Barnes's reaction on air then we highly recommend you go back and have a listen. Beautiful stuff. We love ya, Barnsey. By Velvet Winter",

He not only saw the rock band play live, but went to the local pub with the band members afterwards. But laughing together and clinking glasses in the dimly lit pub in 1975, he could not have predicted their mammoth international success. The now multi-platinum rock band toured Australia in 1975 and visited regional towns such as Katanning, nearly 300 kilometres south-east of Perth, where Mr Ladyman worked at the local radio station. Tickets to AC/DC's Katanning concert in 1975 cost $3.20.(Supplied: Great Southern Herald) \"They were a new band and like all the bands \u2026 they needed to be promoted, so the way to do it was to contact the local radio station,\" he said. Now a retired farmer, Mr Ladyman said there was an obvious \"buzz\" around town as locals waited in anticipation to see the band perform. \"It was huge. It was in the Katanning Town Hall. I think the hall held about 600 people,\" he said. \"We promoted it as part of the radio station, so [the space] was full. \"It was pretty rowdy, and I just remember when we arrived and met the band, the instruction for me was to stand by the stairs at the stage and not to let any girls on the stage, which I thought was a bit odd but there you go.\" Mr Ladyman said after the gig, he and the band, including Bon Scott, headed to the pub together. \"Don't remember too much really,\" he laughed. \"It was late in the night, I think there were some card games that were going at the time \u2026 I remember being in the bar and drinking beer with these guys.\" The Katanning Town Hall has hosted many acts including AC/DC in 1975.(ABC Great Southern: Kate Forrester) The Sydney-formed rock band were not the only artists to visit the Katanning community. Katanning Travel Centre owner Andrew Pritchard recalled playing cards with Daryl Braithwaite, when he was the lead singer of Sherbet. \"In the '70s and '80s there was just live music everywhere \u2026 but no-one ever imagined that they were going to be world-stage and as big as they were.\" Andrew Pritchard has lived in Katanning since the late 70s.(ABC Great Southern: Kate Forrester) Mr Pritchard said the local shire tried to get INXS to perform at the new recreation centre in 1997. \"When they did actually approach the management of INXS, they said they'd need $100,000 as a starting point and we sort of thought, 'Gosh what would we have to charge ticket-wise?'\" Mr Pritchard said while they were not able to get INXS to play, he had countless fond memories of Australian artists trekking out to his country town. Andrew Pritchard says he played cards with Daryl Braithwaite during Sherbert's 1978 tour of Katanning.(ABC Great Southern: Kate Forrester) Mr Ladyman said it was a pity that bands and festivals \"barely made it to Perth\" these days, let alone the regions. \"It would be nice to get back to the old days, but I just can't see it happening because it's just a numbers thing,\" he said. Regional Sounds arts development officer Sarah Hinton said travel logistics were a barrier to getting acts out of the bigger cities.

Despite this, Ms Hinton said the economic and social impacts of a music festival were \"just massive\". Regional newspaper Hamersley News promoted Aussie band Sherbet when it toured to Karratha in 1978.(Supplied: Hamersley News, Trove) \"At a live music event, you get great entertainment, but then there's also food-truck vendors \u2026 the small businesses that provide the fencing, toilets \u2026 tents, there's the hire cars that help get the artists around, there's hotels,\" she said. \"We will always say that the government can subsidise us, but we will provide a huge return on that investment.\" Ms Hinton said work was being done to get more concerts to regional WA, and triple j's Hottest 100 countdown was a good way to get people to talk about music. \"It's been so nice listening to all these songs on the radio \u2026 and then hearing people call in and talk about their memories,\" she said.",

Australia's share market finished the day higher after a decline in June quarter inflation lifted the likelihood of an interest rate cut in August. Catch up on the day's markets and economics news on our blog. Disclaimer: this blog is not intended as investment advice. By Samuel Yang Prices current around 16:25pm AEST Live updates on the major ASX indices: By Gareth Hutchens According to Reuters,Rio Tinto's first-half underlying profit was its smallest in five years, after being pressured byweak iron ore pricesamid oversupply concerns andslowing China demand, and flaggedrising costs at its Pilbara operations. And looking at Rio's results by product group, you can see how the company'siron ore businessestook the bulk of the hit, with its underlying EBITDA down 24%, from US$8.8 billion to US$6.7 billion in the six months ended 30 June. As per Reuters: Iron ore prices eased in the first half of the year as steel production in top consumer China declined and more supply from Australia, Brazil, and South Africa came to the global market, denting Rio Tinto's earnings from the steel-making raw material. Expectations that China will curb overcapacity in the steel sector and likely restocking before 2025-end could underpin a pickup in pricesto $100 per metric ton towards the year-end, according to a note by Morgan Stanley. Rio Tinto, the world's largest iron ore producer, reported underlying earnings of $4.81 billion for the six months ended June 30, down 16% from a year earlier and missing a Visible Alpha consensus of $5.05 billion. This was the company's weakest first-half performance since 2020. By Gareth Hutchens Rio Tinto'sfirst half year resulthas been posted on the ASX website, now that the market's closed for the day. The mining giant has posted a profit after tax attributable to owners (net earnings) of$US4.5 billion(A$6.9 billion), which isdown 16%over the last six months. It says it had relatively stablenet cash generatedfrom operating activities ofUS$6.9 billion(-2%) andunderlying EDITBAof$US11.5 billion(-5%), despite a 13% lower iron ore price and the impact of cyclones in the March quarter. It will pay an interim ordinary dividend of US$2.4 billion, a 50% payout. By Samuel Yang The Australian sharemarket has risen on Wednesday after softer-than-expected inflation boosted hopes for the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates in August. The ASX 200 closed up 0.6% higher to 8,756, just shy of the record it set on the 18th of July. Real estate and financials led the gains today, while utilities and industrials lost ground. Here were the top and bottom movers of the day. By Kirsten Aiken Hi, I've just finished recording an interview with Westpac's Chief Economist and former RBA Assistant Governor (Economic), Dr Luci Ellis, for tonight'sThe Business. In good news for borrowers, Dr Ellis says the RBA's Monetary Policy Board hasno good argument not to cut rates in August. \"If they do decide to hold, I'd like to see what that argument is.\" If you simply can't wait to see The Business tonight, you can watch my extended interview with Dr Ellis now. But tune into the full program onABC Newsat 8.45pm AEST or after the late news on ABC TV, because we have lots, lots more. *Emilia Terzontakes an in-depth look at the June quarter inflation data; * and co-founder of Atlassian and Chair of the Tech Council,Scott Farquhar, explains why he believes Australia can become one of the world's major data centre hubs. I do really want you to watch us on the television tonight, but here's an early link to the extended version of my interview with Scott Farquhar too. By Samuel Yang Shares of Pilbara Minerals rise 4.9% to $1.75, on track to gain most since July 22, if gains hold. The lithium miner has postedFY sales of 760.1kt, up 7% year on year. However, it logged a 39% fall in FY revenue at $769 million. Share price is down about 19.8% year to date. By Samuel Yang West African Resources rises 4.8% to $2.41 and is set for best day since July 2022. The gold miner has posted Q2 sales of 49,840 oz, up from 48,338 oz in Q1. West African is among the best performers today and has risen about 68% so far this year. By Michael Janda The tsunami warnings from this very large earthquake in Russia's far east have extended across huge swathes of the Pacific. It could (hopefully) all fizzle out into relatively little damage and injury, but it is worth monitoring as it could also cause substantial destruction. We can't bring you the latest, but luckily we have ABC colleagues who are staying across all the major developments. By Michael Janda I\u2019m fairly new to this blog.  I\u2019m keen to know if, historical, there has been as much analysis over the RBA\u2019s next move as we see today (\u201ctoday\u201d in its broadest sense).   There does seem to me to be such a huge amount of analysis, predictions and reporting over the possibility of a 0.25% shift. - Jonathan Hi Jonathan, welcome to our humble business blog, hope you enjoy, stay and recommend! Because the RBA shocked the market quite a bit by not cutting rates in July, there is probably more interest than usual in what it will do in August. But I can assure you, having had many years of access to our audience data, that there is always an inordinate amount of interest in what the RBA is likely to do, even though no-one can predict these things with certainty. By Samuel Yang The ASX 200 index has gained 0.8% or 66 points to 8,771 in after trade after softer-than-expected inflation paved the way for the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates in August. By Samuel Yang Asian stocks rose modestly on Wednesday, with investors cautious after trade talks between the US and China ended without any substantive agreement and ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy announcement. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.3%, led by gains for Taiwanese stocks, after US stocks ended the previous session with mild losses as traders braced for a slew of corporate earnings. Australian shareswere up 0.7%, while Japan's Nikkei stock index slid 0.03%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Indexskidded 0.4%. The euroedged up from a one-month low, rising 0.2% to $1.1564, as markets weighed the EU's trade deal with the Trump administration. Traders are preparing for several central bank decisions, key economic reports and corporate earnings during the next few days, culminating in US President Donald Trump's August 1 tariff deadline. The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its policy meeting later on Wednesday, though it could see a rare dissent by some central bank officials in favour of lower borrowing costs. \"With labour market conditions near full employment, most Fed officials want to wait and see how tariffs impact inflation,\" said Tom Kenny, senior international economist at ANZ in Sydney. Some officials are concerned that tariffs could drive higher inflation expectations, leading to more persistent price pressures rather than a one-off hit, he said on a podcast. \"Our expectation is that the Fed should be in a position to cut rates at the September meeting.\" With Reuters By Michael Janda Canstar's Sally Tindallnotes that the detail of the quarterly inflation figures were positive from the perspective of allowing further interest rate reductions. \"Services inflation printed at 3.3% annually, down from 3.7% \u2014 the lowest since June 2022. This includes a notable slowing in rental price rises, which recorded a 4.5% rise annually. While this may seem high, it is down from an annual rate of 5.5% recorded in the previous quarter. Similarly, insurances clocked in at 3.9%, down from 7.6%,\" she observes. It's also important to note, when looking atservices inflation, that it has historically been above 3% per annum,averaging 3.2% since September 2001(once the inflationary effects of the GST had washed out). So 3.3% is pretty close to this century's average for services inflation. This is necessary to keep overall inflation within the target range of 2-3%, as Australia has imported a lot of deflation in key manufactured goods, such as clothing, cars and, particularly, electronics over the past few decades. Tindall also noted very low price rises in one of the CPI's biggest weighted categories. \"New dwelling inflation continued to head towards zero, with an annual inflation rate of 0.7%, down from 1.4% in the previous quarter and down from the peak in September 2022 of 20.7%.\" All in all, she believes that makes an August 12 rate cut extremely likely, but not something you should count on yet when budgeting. \"While an RBA cut looks to be a near-certainty, if you've got a mortgage, don't bank on any extra cash until it lands in your bank account. The RBA has shown it doesn't dance to the beat of market expectations \u2014 it's the one steering the ship. \"Banks are also at the helm of your mortgage and while we expect the big banks to step up to the plate and pass the next cut on in full, there's no guarantee every lender will do this.\" If it is passed on in full,Canstar says it'll save someone with a $600,000 mortgage around $90 a month. BDO economics partner Anders Magnussonsays the RBA runs a real risk of slowing the economy more than it needs to. \"With inflation clearly moderating and monetary policy already restrictive, holding rates steady may now risk constraining growth more than necessary,\" he warns. \"Recent data from Roy Morgan highlights that mortgage stress is rising sharply, with 28.4% of mortgage holders now considered 'at risk'. This is the highest level since January, despite the rate cuts delivered earlier this year, driven not just by interest rates but by larger loan sizes and elevated property prices. \"While monetary policy alone can't solve all pressures facing households, with inflation contained, the RBA has room to act and ease the burden on those most affected.\" By Michael Janda Why are you not mentioning the monthly 1.9% monthly CPI figure. That seems quite low and is obviously below the RBA\u2019s target. - A Hi A. The answer to this goes back to Sam's question earlier. The inflation numbers released today by the ABS include the long-standing quarterly data, which the RBA trusts. The monthly data is still quite new, and each month doesn't represent a complete dataset of prices across all major sectors of consumer spending \u2014 there are bits missing. That's why the RBA still prefers the well establishedquarterly Consumer Price Index, which is published separately from themonthly Consumer Price IndexIndicator(the last word offers a further hint here as to why the quarterly data is preferred). Luckily, the ABS is moving to publishing complete monthly inflation data from November onwards. As RBA governor Michele Bullock said last week, \"Yay ABS!\" In the meantime, the RBA probably would be taking additional comfort from the monthly CPI Indicator, which clearly shows the downward trend in inflation is continuing. If anything, I'd argue the RBA should be a little more alarmed by the monthly figures, because they seem to be front-running the quarterly data and, as you rightly point out, the headline number isbelowthe RBA's 2-3% target range. I do think there's a real risk, given the lags in monetary policy, that inflation undershoots 2% if the RBA doesn't cut rates at least a couple more times soon. The RBA's economic modelling doesn't agree. Then again, the bank consistently undershot its inflation target prior to the pandemic by relying on its modelling, so personally I'd trust the trends we're actually seeing in the ABS data ahead of any economic model. By Samuel Yang Australia's biggest bank, the Commonwealth, has been singled out by the corporate regulator for refusing to refund thousands of low-income customers, who were charged unnecessary fees. To get more on this our Chief Business CorrespondentIan Verrendersat down with ASIC CommissionerAlan Kirkland. By Business Correspondent David Taylor Hi, DT jumping into the blog for a sec. It's so easy to get lost in all the inflation and RBA stuff. So, I've put together a little explainer looking atwhat the RBA wants -- because that will tell you where interest rates are heading. By Samuel Yang Deloitte Access Economics partner Stephen Smith says today\u2019s inflation data showsAustralia\u2019s policy settings must shift from containing inflation to stimulating economic growth. The latest consumer price index (CPI) update shows headline inflation for the 12 months to the June quarter coming in at 2.1 per cent and underlying inflation coming in at 2.7 per cent. \"This is consistent with the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) annual underlying inflation forecast of 2.6 per cent and should see the RBA cut rates in August,\" Mr Smith said in a note. \"Not only is inflation continuing to move to the midpoint of the RBA\u2019s target band, the current cash rate of 3.85 per cent is still well above the RBA\u2019s estimate of the neutral cash rate. \"In other words, the bank knows its monetary policy settings are restricting growth. This is hard to justify given ongoing global economic volatility and the continued sluggishness of our own domestic economy.\" Mr Smith pointed out that Australian retail figures from earlier this month came in below forecasts, showingconsumers are prioritising saving over spending. \"For these reasons, Deloitte Access Economics continues to forecast a further 50 basis points of rate cuts over the remainder of 2025, followed by another 50 basis points in 2026,\" he said. By Michael Janda Are these CPI figures the ones that the RBA will trust or not ? - Sam Hi Sam, Good question. Yes, these are the long-established, highly trusted quarterly Consumer Price Index numbers that the majority of RBA board members were waiting to see before cutting interest rates again. With the bank's preferred trimmed mean figure coming in lower than the March quarter, roughly in-line with the RBA's most recent forecasts and close to the middle of its 2-3% target band, every economist whose note I've read so far expects a cut on August 12. Of course, most of them expected a cut in July, which didn't happen, so it's never totally a \"done deal\". But I think there'd be a dangerous level of shock and disbelief on the markets, and an erosion of confidence in the RBA Monetary Policy Board, if it didn't cut in a fortnight. Markets are pricing in a 93% chance of a cut next month, which is about as close as they get to certain. By Michael Janda That's the view ofBetashares chief economist David Bassanese, who was one of the few economists expressing caution about the prospects of a rate cut in July. However, now he says the extra evidence that inflation is continuing to fall to the middle of the RBA's target range makes an August 12 rate cut a slam dunk. \"The good news is that annual trimmed mean inflation has fallen from 2.9% in the March quarter to 2.7% in the June quarter. In turn, this reflects broad based easing in goods, services, and housing related inflation,\" he notes. \"Although this is a touch higher than the Reserve Bank's May forecast of 2.6% \u2014my view is near enough is good enough and an August rate cut now seems a done deal. \"Underlying inflation is inching closer to the middle of the RBA's 2 to 3% target band and so justifies a further easing in what are \u2014 in the RBA's own words \u2014 a still 'modestly restrictive' level of interest rates.\" And pretty much every other economist note I've read reaches pretty much the same conclusion. If there was strong surprise the RBA didn't cut in July, there'd be outright shock and disbelief in the rate watching community if it still refused to cut in August. By Samuel Yang Treasurer JimChalmers has commented on the June quarter CPI data. Here is a little bit of what he had to say: These are very welcome inflation numbers. They are a powerful demonstration on the progress that Australians have made together in the fight against inflation. These numbers represent remarkable, \noutstanding progress. When you consider that when we came to office, headline inflation was three times higher than what it is into these numbers today. What we have seen today is quarterly inflation, monthly information, headline and trend mean, goods and services inflation all come down. This is the \nlowest inflation in almost four years. These are very pleasing, very welcome, absolutely outstanding inflation numbers when you consider how far Australians have come together in this fight against inflation. When we came to office, inflation was much higher and it was absolutely galloping, and \nin the course of the last three years, we have been able to get headline inflation at the very bottom of the Reserve Bank's target range. We have also got trimmed mean inflation in the Reserve Bank's target range as well. By Michael Janda Following last month's surprise 6-3 vote to keep interest rates on hold,Westpac's chief economist (and former RBA assistant governor) Luci Ellisnow expects a unanimous decision from the board on August 12 to cut rates. \"We suspect that today's data will come as something of a relief to the RBA,\" she notes. \"By cementing the inflation case to cut, it removes any awkwardness around the signs of a renewed softening in the labour market, which would otherwise conflict with its response to inflation risks. RBA Governor Bullock downplayed the pick-up in unemployment in the month of June, rightly emphasising that one should never get hung up on one monthly read of a volatile series. The increase also took the quarterly average unemployment rate exactly in line with the RBA's May forecast for June quarter. If, however, the RBA were to keep the cash rate on hold again in August, only to see further softening in the labour market in the July data released two days after the meeting, it would complicate its strategy and communication. \"If we are correct that the RBA MPB does cut in August,the path from there also looks increasingly likely to line up with our current forecast of cuts in November, then February and May 2026. \"Assuming our expectations are borne out, that would take thecash rate to a trough of 2.85%. We think this is at the lower end of what could be regarded as neutral, and would reflect the RBA's response to a path for underlying inflation that turns out a little lower than what it forecast in May.\" ABC/Reuters",

The \"trimmed mean\" measure of inflation, which is the Reserve Bank's preferred measure of underlying inflation, also declined. It fell from 2.9 to 2.7 per cent between March and June, which broadly matches the Reserve Bank's forecasts from May. The Reserve Bank had been expected to cut the cash rate to 3.6 per cent, to its lowest since April 2023. The RBA's official forecasts had trimmed mean inflation slipping to 2.6 per cent by this stage, and for headline inflation to be 2.1 per cent. Westpac's chief economist Luci Ellis said today's data confirmed inflation was under control and the RBA was now likely to cut interest rates at its August meeting. \"Further cuts in November, February 2026 and May 2026 also look increasingly likely,\" Ms Ellis said. In the RBA board's recent rates meeting, a majority of its members voted to keep interest rates on hold this month rather than to cut rates, saying they wanted to wait for more information to confirm that inflation was under control. But a week later, new data showed the national unemployment rate had picked up from 4.1 to 4.3 per cent in June, to a three-year high. RBA governor Michele Bullock later downplayed that rise in unemployment, saying it was not higher than the RBA had been forecasting, and the RBA was still concerned about getting inflation down. Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock says despite last month's surprise jump in the unemployment rate, the numbers matched the RBA's recent forecasts from May. But Ms Ellis said this June quarter inflation data gave the RBA the room it needed to cut rates again. \"Today's data removes any awkwardness posed by inflation remaining too high for the RBA's comfort, at the same time that the labour market might be starting to ease again,\" Ms Ellis said. \"Further softening in the labour market would sit uncomfortably with a decision to hold the cash rate at restrictive levels when underlying inflation is so close to target.\" David Bassanese, BetaShares chief economist, said the decline in trimmed mean inflation reflected broad-based easing in goods, services, and housing-related inflation. \"Although this is a touch higher than the Reserve Bank's May forecast of 2.6 per cent, my view is 'near enough is good enough' and an August rate cut now seems a done deal,\" he said. But he said the data also demonstrated that RBA governor Bullock was right to be cautious about cutting rates before she saw this inflation data. Earlier this month, Ms Bullock had raised concerns about the reliability of the ABS's separate Monthly Inflation Indicator data, which suggested that inflation was much weaker than today's figures showed. \"It turns out the governor was right to be cautious,\" Mr Bassanese said. \"Until the methodology used in the monthly CPI reports is improved, this highlights the importance of focusing on the quarterly CPI results when making interest rate policy decisions.\" The ABS says the main contributor to the slowdown in the pace of annual headline inflation was a large fall in automotive fuel prices. Fuel prices were 10 per cent lower in the June quarter of 2025 compared to a year ago. The average cost of unleaded petrol for the June 2025 quarter was $1.77 per litre, which was 21 cents per litre lower than in the June 2024 quarter. The ABS says annual price rises for insurance (+3.9 per cent), rents (+4.5 per cent) and new dwellings (+0.7 per cent) also continued to slow in the June quarter. Annual inflation for food and non-alcoholic beverages has also remained around 3 per cent for the past five quarters. Fruit and vegetable prices rose 4.6 per cent in the 12 months to the June quarter, down from 6.6 per cent to the March quarter. The prices for \"non-discretionary\" goods and services had a quarterly rise of 0.7 per cent, and an annual rise of 1.8 per cent. The rise in the June quarter was driven by fruit and vegetables (+4.3 per cent), electricity (+8.1 per cent), rents (+1 per cent) and medical and hospital services (+2.3 per cent). The quarterly rise was partially offset by automotive fuel (-3.4 per cent). The prices for \"discretionary goods\" and services had a quarterly rise of 0.7 per cent and an annual rise of 2.4 per cent. The rise in the June quarter was driven by international holiday travel and accommodation (+4.7 per cent), garments (+3.5 per cent) and furniture (+2.9 per cent).",

        "summary": "Scott Farquhar has used a National Press Club address to call for government support to enable the rapid construction of more data centres and renewable energy to power them. Mr Farquhar said, with changes to copyright laws, Australia could provide much of South-East Asia's rapidly expanding data storage needs.",
        "raw_text": "Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar believes Australia can become one of the world's major data centre hubs, powered by renewable energy. While his Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes struggles to advance his planned Suncable project to generate vast amounts of solar energy in the Northern Territory and send it via an underwater cable to Singapore, Mr Farquhar has proposed a different way for Australia to export its green energy. \"We should power the region,\" he said in a speech to the National Press Club. \"We should export megawatts as megabytes for potentially megabucks. This could be a $10 billion-plus opportunity.\" Speaking to The Business ahead of his speech, Mr Farquhar said he envisaged Australia becoming the data centre location of choice for South-East Asia, a region hungry for data and becoming hungrier as artificial intelligence took off. \"There are more users of ChatGPT in the combined Indonesia and Vietnam than there are in the United States,\" he told the program. \"This region is growing, it's dynamic in Asia, so there's going to be a lot of demand for data centres going forward.\" Mr Farquhar explained why Australia was uniquely well placed to host the data centres necessary to store all this information. Data centres whirr away, critical to so much of our daily lives, yet they don't often make the headlines. But that is starting to change. \"Abundant energy, clean energy, and the other one is a stable rule of law,\" he argued. \"In this increasing world of geopolitics, our access to cutting-edge chips at the behest of the United States is an advantage for us.\" Mr Farquhar also said Australia was surprisingly cost-competitive when it came to building and operating data centres. \"I found it surprising because, obviously, we have a relatively high cost of labour,\" he told The Business. \"But because we have a deep talent pool here, because of the low cost of energy and clean energy that we have in Australia, and the ability to scale up with raw materials, all those things actually put us in a great and very competitive situation in the world stage. \"And so I was honestly surprised at how competitive Australia is. \"Again, we just need improved planning approvals to move faster both on the energy and approving of data centres.\" As one of the small group of people hand-picked to attend the Economic Reform Roundtable at Parliament House in Canberra on August 19-21, he will have an opportunity to present these arguments directly to the federal government. With the major data centre operators and cloud-computing providers committed to renewable energy, according to Mr Farquhar, he argued his plan could accelerate the clean energy rollout. \"So this revolution will be powered by green energy, and nuclear might be here in 10 years, but it's not going to be here anytime soon,\" he said. \"And so, as a result, it's really going to be solar, wind and batteries that are going to power this revolution. \"And what we're seeing is that you can actually install solar, wind and batteries very quickly once you can get through all the approvals. And so my call on government is to make it easier for us as a nation to install this power that we need.\" Scott Farquhar said the tech industry was generally requiring that its power came from renewable sources.(Supplied: Cogency) In his speech, Mr Farquhar also called for another regulatory change to facilitate an expansion of the data centre industry in Australia. \"Australia's copyright laws are out of sync with the rest of the world,\" he argued. \"Today, large language model providers don't want to train their models in Australia. \"We are in a perverse situation where copyright holders aren't seeing any more money, but we also don't see the economic upside of training models in Australia.\" Responding to concerns that the growing number of data centres was already placing strains on Australia's energy grid, and potentially pushing up power prices, Mr Farquhar said he believed that the increasing and reliable demand for power could have the opposite effect. Australian power demand rose relentlessly until 2008, when it stopped growing. That record has finally been eclipsed, and experts say it is a sign of things to come. \"What happens is, as the grid gets larger, it becomes more stable,\" he told The Business. \"There's more points of access putting energy in more, pulling it out, and so the grid can actually become cheaper the more things you connect to it. \"So a grid that powers more data centres, additional to the electricity needs of the nation, is going to be more stable and cheaper.\" Overall, Mr Farquhar used his speech to urge Australians and their political leaders to embrace artificial intelligence, rather than fear it. \"Just as we don't lament that fewer people toil in fields, we won't lament that fewer people answer repetitive questions in call centres,\" he argued. \"But the history of technological change shows us something important: Every major technological wave has created more jobs than it has displaced. Human capital has adapted and stayed relevant every time.\"",

It says it takes seriously concerns raised over the decision to waive the debt. Tax experts have called for transparency to ensure public confidence in Australia's tax system.",
        "raw_text": "The Australian Taxation Office has moved to allay fears powerful individuals are given special treatment, saying it will review how it made a decision to wipe almost $1 million in penalties and interest from a company owned by former prime minister Paul Keating. \"We are following up to ensure all processes were correctly adhered to,\" the ATO said in a statement following Monday night's Four Corners program. Four Corners revealed an abrupt about face from the tax office in 2015, which followed three years of negotiations and came after a formal payment notice for $953,000 was issued to Mr Keating's company. The decision was unusual because, for most taxpayers, formally challenging such a ruling on a so-called general interest charge (GIC) would typically require them to contest the matter in the Federal Court. \"We note concerns raised in the segment about GIC remission for a high-profile taxpayer, which we take seriously,\" the ATO's statement said. \"Where concerns are raised, we aim to respond through appropriate channels, including internal review, independent oversight, and, where necessary, improvements to our systems and processes. \"The public rightfully expects the highest standards of integrity, fairness and accountability from us, and we take matters raised in the segment seriously.\" Paul Keating was the Australian prime minister from 1991 to 1996.(Reuters: Claro Cortes) Jason Harris, a professor of corporate law at Sydney University, said the decision to waive the interest and penalties charge had the potential to undermine public trust in the tax system. \"We have an example of someone very famous seemingly getting a special deal without any explanation and that should be a matter of public concern, even outside of tax,\" he said. \"If we had a former PM getting a waiver on a driver's licence fee we should be equally concerned. There should be transparency.\" The tax debt was discovered in 2012 when the tax office realised that a company owned by Mr Keating had not reported profits from a 2004 share sale. While the company, Brenlex Pty Ltd, later paid the $446,000, the ATO then demanded more than $600,000 in interest and penalties that had accrued in the eight years since the sale occurred. The negotiations stretched over three years, during which time Mr Keating's advisers asked for the debt to be written off via a tax rule called a \"commissioner's discretion\". Mr Keating's advisers sought the exemption because the former prime minister mistakenly believed Brenlex had paid the tax and had \"inadvertently failed to advise his directors\" of the sale, the advisers told the tax office. Professor Harris said a commissioner's discretion was generally applied when a taxpayer had experienced some form of unfairness, such as bad advice from an accountant, or where there had been a significant event in their life, such as the death of a loved one. He said the reason Mr Keating's advisers gave \u2014 that he had forgotten he had not complied \u2014 did not pass muster. \"It's outrageous,\" he said. The ATO initially demanded more than $600,000 in interest and penalties.(Four Corners: Sissy Reyes) In April 2015, the ATO issued Mr Keating a statutory demand for payment of the bill, which by then had grown to $953,396. Ten days after a final letter from Mr Keating's advisers, the tax office decided to cancel the debt in full. \"I am able to confirm that the GIC and Late Lodgement Penalties \u2026 have been remitted in full,\" a tax official wrote. \"Consequently the balance of the account has been reduced to nil and the amount payable as stated in the Creditors Statutory Demand is no longer owed.\" The email provided no reasons for the tax office's abrupt about face after three years of resisting the arguments of Mr Keating's financial advisers. The principal tax adviser at Australia's Institute of Public Accountants, Tony Greco, said the decision to waive Mr Keating's GIC appeared unusual on its face. \"From a normal perspective, forgetting to pay your tax wouldn't be a strong case for remission of the GIC,\" he said. \"More information needs to be provided to see whether they [the tax office] acted within their discretion.\" Professor of taxation law at UNSW, Michael Walpole, cautioned that not enough was known about Mr Keating's matter to be able to draw any firm conclusion. Speaking generally, he said it was desirable that, as long as they relied on the appropriate protocols, the tax office be able to reach settlements with taxpayers. The ATO told Four Corners in a statement last week that \"inadvertently overlooking\" the need to pay tax was generally not valid grounds on which to cancel GIC. \"However, there may be instances where GIC is remitted when a taxpayer inadvertently overlooks the requirement to lodge a form or make a payment, depending on the individual circumstances of the taxpayer,\" the ATO said.",

        "raw_text": "Australia's economic growth forecasts have been revised upwards by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), despite ongoing uncertainty around Donald Trump's tariffs. Since April, the agency has upgraded Australia's projected GDP growth, from 1.6 to 1.8 per cent, in 2025, and from 2.1 to 2.2 per cent, in 2026. Australia's result mirrored the IMF's expectations for the global economy, which were also revised up for this year and next year. But it was still warning of a slowdown in global growth compared to the last several years. \"Overall, risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside,\" the IMF's report warned. US President Donald Trump is threatening higher trade tariffs against economies which do not strike deals with his administration by August 1.(Getty Images: Jim Lo Scalo/EPA/Bloomberg) Among the biggest boosts to this forecast, and largest unknowns in the future, was Donald Trump's trade tariffs, as US firms sought to bring forward imports to beat the president's August 1 deadline. Several major economies, includingthe European Union, theUnited KingdomandJapanhave struck deals with the Trump administration in recent weeks to avoid paying higher duties. Under Donald Trump's tariff program, Australia appeared to be one of America's least badly treated friends. But, without a new deal, the president's latest idea would change that. \"The US effective tariff rate underlying the projections is 17.3 per cent, compared with 24.4 per cent in the April reference forecast,\" the report said. The April forecast was madenot long after Mr Trump unveiled his \"liberation day\" tariffswhich applied heavy tariffs on some of America's biggest trading partners, and a 10 per cent \"baseline\" tariff on most other economies, including Australia. Earlier this week, Mr Trump floated raising that baseline rate from 10 per cent tosomewhere between 15 and 20 per cent. It added that inflation has \"ticked up\" in the US due to tariffs and a weakening US dollar. But among the biggest adjustments to the IMF's forecasts comes from Australia's largest trading partner, China, which is expected to grow at 4.8 per cent in 2025 \u2014 0.8 per cent more than what the IMF predicted in April. \"This revision reflects stronger-than-expected activity in the first half of 2025 and the significant reduction in US\u2013China tariffs,\" the report said.

        "raw_text": "It could be a throw-away line or a massive blow to the Australian economy delivered by US President Donald Trump. Australia thought it was relatively safe from Trump's tariff war. It turns out we could have been wrong. Once again, the US president seemed to be confirming a shift in his trade policy as an aside in a larger press conference. Trump loves to boast about his freewheeling speaking style \u2014 his so-called \"weave,\" where he jumps from topic to topic in a way that might make someone think he's lost his train of thought, though he insists it's always clear in the end. He was holding court at his Turnberry Golf Course in Scotland. He was visiting a foreign country \u2014 the UK \u2014 but he was the one playing host to the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, and setting the terms of the interaction. There were plenty of awkward moments for Sir Keir, who had to politely listen to Trump rail against the scourge of wind farms, which he claimed were ruining the views from his golf course, and how damaging he believed illegal immigration had been to Britain. But, the hardest part for the Australian prime minister to hear was likely when Trump began talking about the next stage of his one-man tariff offensive against the world. Donald Trump suggests the US's 10 per cent \"baseline\" tariff, which is placed on most of Australia's exports to the US, could soon increase to 15 or 20 per cent. Fresh off claiming an agreement had been reached with the European Union \u2014 although details remain elusive \u2014 Trump acknowledged that doing individual trade deals with other countries was quite time-consuming. Who would've thought? Once again, he remarked with seemingly genuine shock at how many countries exist in the world: \"You have 200 countries \u2014 more. People don't get that.\" Even though he'd previously boasted that countries were desperate to do deals with him, he now seemed resigned to the fact that he couldn't get them individually ticked off. So, he has a more efficient idea: \"We're going to be setting a tariff for essentially the rest of the world. And that's what they're going to pay if they want to do business in the United States. Because you can't sit down and make 200 deals.\" Sound familiar? Back in April, during his \"Liberation Day\" announcement, Trump said almost all countries would be hit with a 10 per cent \"baseline\" tariff. Many were also slapped with higher \"reciprocal\" rates, though most of those were subsequently put on hold. They're due to come into effect this week for countries that haven't struck deals with the US. Australia only received the baseline rate, largely because it buys more from the US than it sells. But Trump clearly doesn't think that baseline rate cuts it anymore. He said it would likely be lifted to \"somewhere in the 15 to 20 per cent range\", an idea he had first floated during a phone interview with NBC earlier this month. If this comes to pass \u2014 and it's a big \"if\", given Trump's tendency to announce policy one day and backtrack the next \u2014 it would be a massive economic blow to Australian businesses that export to the US. While the current 10 per cent impost makes Australian products more expensive for US consumers and less competitive relative to American goods, it was thought to give Australian businesses a leg up compared to countries hit with reciprocal tariffs. Donald Trump has been visiting Scotland, where he has a golf club.(Reuters: Phil Noble) It had looked like 10 per cent was the floor rate, and no other country would receive a more favourable arrangement. It also gave Australia little incentive to negotiate a better deal with the US, since the Trump administration didn't seem willing to go lower than 10 per cent or drop it entirely. But if Trump now imposes a 20 per cent baseline tariff, Australia will be disadvantaged compared to countries that have already struck better deals \u2014 or at least \"frameworks\" of deals. The UK, Japan, and now the EU have all said they've secured deals where their exports to the US are hit with a 15 per cent duty. So, from being the least badly treated friend, Australia might now be getting worse treatment than many large economies. It would also seem, on face value, to be clearly unfair, even based on Trump's own questionable tariff logic. Australia had a lower rate because the administration said it was allowing better access for US goods. But now it may well face a higher tariff than the EU, which Trump has previously bashed as one of the most egregious blockers of American trade ambitions. Six months into his second term, it's difficult to know when Trump is clearly stating a new policy or just thinking out loud in front of the world's media. But his words seem pretty clear on this occasion: he's planning to raise the baseline tariff, and that's going to hurt Australian businesses. Trump's Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said last week that Trump wasn't planning to hike the baseline. But in the Trump administration, the only word that seems to matter is his. Perhaps it's a negotiating tactic, though countries only facing the baseline tariff weren't even sent the recent letters Trump fired off, imploring leaders to do a deal. Even if this is just a thought bubble, Australia's leaders will need to take it seriously because when it comes to Trump, thought bubbles can be highly consequential.",

His admission on Tuesday, local time, came as Epstein's long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell sought immunity from future prosecution as a condition for testifying to a US congressional committee. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One while flying home from Scotland, Mr Trump gave some of his most expansive public comments yet about his falling out with Epstein, the wealthy and well-connected financier who died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking underage girls. \"People were taken out of the [Mar-a-Lago] spa, hired by him, in other words, gone,\" Mr Trump said. \"When I heard about it, I told him, I said, 'Listen, we don't want you taking our people.' \"And then, not too long after that, he did it again. And I said, 'Out of here.'\" Donald Trump, Melania Trump, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2000.(Getty Images: Davidoff Studios) Mr Trump also confirmed that one of the Mar-a-Lago spa attendants taken by Epstein was Ms Giuffre, the Australian who brought a civil case against Epstein's friend Prince Andrew, accusing him of sexually assaulting her when she was 17. Ms Giuffre, who accused Epstein of using her as a sex slave, took her own life at her home in Australia in April. \"I think she worked at the spa,\" Mr Trump told reporters. \"I think that was one of the people. He stole her.\" The White House has said previously Mr Trump threw Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club two decades ago \"for being a creep\", and US media have reported that they became estranged over a Florida real estate deal. Virginia Giuffre accused Epstein of using her as a sex slave.(Reuters: Shannon Stapleton) Mr Trump's comments came as lawyers for Ms Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend, said they were open to having their client cooperate with Congress, but wanted her to be guaranteed immunity by politicians first. The Republican-led House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform aims to conduct a deposition of the British socialite on August 11 at the Florida prison where she is serving a 20-year sentence. Maxwell was convicted in New York in 2021 of helping Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of helping Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls.(Reuters: Jane Rosenberg) \"Ms Maxwell cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity,\" Maxwell's lawyer, David Markus, told Representative James Comer, who chairs the House committee, in a letter. Mr Markus laid down additional conditions for a deposition, including conducting it somewhere other than the prison, and being provided with the committee's questions in advance. He added that his client would testify to the committee in a public setting if she were to be granted clemency. Maxwell is asking the US Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. Mr Trump has said he is not considering a presidential pardon for her. Donald Trump crosses the tarmac in Scotland with his grandchildren.(Reuters: Evelyn Hockstein) Questions over Mr Trump's past relationship with Epstein and his administration's handling of records related to the case have dogged the president for weeks, including during a weekend visit to Scotland. Mr Trump knew Epstein socially in the 1990s and early 2000s. He said that he cut off ties with Epstein years before Epstein's death. Democrats in Congress and some of Mr Trump's core supporters have demanded the release of documents involving Epstein and Maxwell. Epstein served a 13-month jail sentence after pleading guilty in 2008 to a Florida state felony prostitution charge. AP/AFP",

        "raw_text": "Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, known for its weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, has named Maziar Mike Doustdar as its new chief executive, relying on an experienced company insider to make up ground lost to market rivals. Mr Doustdar's appointment came on Tuesday after Novo and the Novo Nordisk Foundation \u2014 the company's controlling shareholder \u2014abruptly removed his predecessor, Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, in May. The CEO of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, known for its blockbuster weight-loss drug Ozempic, will step down, the drug maker has said. The new CEO joined Novo in 1992. He has been serving as vice-president for international operations, a role he took after leading the company's businesses first in the Middle East and then in South-East Asia, according to Novo. His most urgent challenge, according to investors and analysts, is to revive Novo's performance in the United States, the largest market by far for weight-loss drugs and where they are most profitable. Novo launched its weight-loss drug Wegovy nearly two and a half years before its US rival Eli Lilly's Zepbound. Zepbound prescriptions surpassed those of Wegovy this year by more than 100,000 a week. The appointment comes at a challenging time for the global pharmaceutical industry as US President Donald Trump threatens to impose tariffs on imports and calls on drug makers to lower their American prescription prices. Novo Nordisk is most well known for its weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic.(Reuters: Hollie Adams) Mr Jorgensen led Novo through a period of meteoric growth as it led the weight-loss drug boom, becoming Europe's most valuable listed company after the launch of Wegovy in 2021. At its peak in June 2024 Novo was worth as much as $US615 billion ($946.4b). Novo shares have plunged over the past 12 months, amid investor concerns about the company's experimental drug pipeline and its ability to navigate challenges in the US market, such as the threat to its sales from compounded copies of Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound. On Tuesday, Novo cut its full-year sales and operating profit forecasts for the second time this year, sending its shares down as much as 17 per cent. People on Ozempic and other GLP-1 agonist drugs commonly report they no longer have constant, incessant thoughts about food. \"The lowered sales outlook for 2025 is driven by lower growth expectations for the second half of 2025,\" the company said in a statement. \"This is related to lower growth expectations for Wegovy in the US obesity market, lower growth expectations for Ozempic in the US GLP-1 diabetes market, as well as lower-than-expected penetration for Wegovy in select IO (International Operations) markets.\" Novo now expects 2025 sales growth of between eight and 14 per cent in local currencies, down from its previous forecast range of between 13 and 21 per cent. It also lowered its operating profit growth estimate to between 10 and 16 per cent, down from 16 to 24 per cent previously. Sales rose 18 per cent year-on-year in both the second quarter and the first half of the year, Novo said. Its operating profit increased by 40 per cent in the April-June quarter and by 29 per cent in the first half, the company added. Booming sales of Wegovy catapulted Novo to become Europe's most valuable listed company in 2024, peaking at about 615 billion euros ($1.09t), but the value has since fallen by more than half. The company is scheduled to release full second-quarter earnings on August 6. Reuters",

The prime minister says the government won't be intimidated by Google's threats to sue over YouTube's inclusion.",
        "raw_text": "The prime minister has vowed not to be intimidated by Google, as the tech giant threatens to sue over the government's decision to restrict children and teenagers from accessing YouTube. Australians under the age of 16 will be barred from logging in to YouTube when thesocial media bancomes into force in December, after the government reversed its plan to grant the video-sharing site an exemption. Rules of how the ban will operate are set to be presented to parliament on Wednesday, including details of the types of platforms that won't be captured, such as those primarily concerned with gaming, messaging, health and education. It comes days after Google, the parent company of YouTube, threatened legal action if the government scrapped its previously flagged exemption on the basis of the platform's educational uses. Communications Minister Anika Wells issued a blunt retort to the tech giant. \"We can't control the ocean, but we can police the sharks, and that is why we will not be intimidated by legal threats when this is a genuine fight for the wellbeing of Australian kids,\" Ms Wells said. Australia's eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant says she is confident the implementation of laws banning young people from social media will be complete by the December deadline, but people should not expect them to work overnight. Flanked by parents whose children had died as a consequence of bullying on social media, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he would also be promoting Australia's social media ban on the sidelines of the next major United Nations conference in New York in September. \"I know from the discussions I have had with other leaders that they are looking at this and they are considering what impact social media is having on young people in their respective nations, it is a common experience,\" he said. \"We don't do this easily. What we do, though, is respond to something that is needed here.\" YouTube Kids is expected to be spared from the new laws because it does not allow users to communicate with others through the platform. Unlike other popular social media sites, YouTube does not require users to have an account to access most features and young people will still be able to use the site in a logged-out state after the world-leading laws come into effect. But including YouTube in the list of social media platforms covered by the ban \u2014 which already includes apps like TikTok and Instagram \u2014 means under 16s won't be able to access age-restricted content on the video-sharing site. In a statement on Wednesday, the eSafety Commission welcomed the \"important milestone\" of the release of the rules, noting there would be no blanket exceptions for platforms. The commissioner is tasked separately with determining what steps platforms will be expected to take to comply with the new laws. \"Following the release of theAge Assurance Technology Trialreport, eSafety will publish these guidelines to support industry's compliance with the legislation,\" they said. Former communications minister Michelle Rowland initially flagged that YouTube was likely to be exempt from the laws in November last year. But the proposed carve out was thrown into question last month when eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant \u2014 who is tasked with implementing the laws \u2014 wrote to new Communications Minister Anika Wells formally recommending it be scrapped. She cited eSafety research that found young people usedYouTube more than any other social media platform and it was where they were most likely to experience harm online. \"When we asked where they were experiencing harm and the kinds of harms they were experiencing, the most prevalent place where young Australians experienced harm was on YouTube \u2014 almost 37 per cent,\" Dr Inman Grant said. \"This ranges from misogynistic content to hateful material, to violent fighting videos, online challenges, disordered eating, suicidal ideation.\" The federal government has doubled down on its decision to give YouTube a carve-out from the teen social media ban, despite privately assuring rival platforms that \"no final decisions\" have been made, the ABC can reveal. She also argued that YouTube had the characteristics of a platform that should fall under the ban and cautioned against naming specific platforms for carve outs. The platform's competitors had separately campaigned against its exclusion, accusing thegovernment of making a \"sweetheart deal\" in private submissions. YouTube has argued that it is a video streaming platform, rather than a social media site, and therefore should not be captured by the ban, citing evidence that it is widely used in classrooms and by parents. \"We share the government's goal of addressing and reducing online harms. Our position remains clear: YouTube is a video sharing platform with a library of free, high-quality content, increasingly viewed on TV screens. It's not social media,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"The government's announcement today reverses a clear, public commitment to exclude YouTube from this ban. We will consider next steps and will continue to engage with the government.\" Under the new laws, which are due to come into force on December 10, social media companies will face fines of up to almost $50 million for failing to take \"reasonable steps\" to bar under-16s from their platforms.",

The federal government is announcing an expansion of its Capacity Investment Scheme to encourage investment in renewable energy generation.",
        "raw_text": "The father of emissions trading in Australia has warned the nation is \"on a path to comprehensive failure\" without the urgent reintroduction of a carbon price. Speaking at the Australian Clean Energy Summit in Sydney, Professor Ross Garnaut said the Albanese government had the right objectives on renewable generation, emissions reduction and supporting new export industries based on clean energy. However, he added that, despite the Albanese government's \"Herculean efforts\", Australia looked set to fall short of its objectives. \"Failure to reach them will have tragic consequences for Australian productivity, budgetary strength and contribution to the global climate mitigation effort,\" he argued. Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen is announcing an expansion of the Capacity Investment Scheme.(ABC News: Callum Flinn) Professor Garnaut's speech comes as Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen is preparing to announce an extension of the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS), which promotes investment in renewable energy generation. \"In three short years, we have seen Capacity Investment Scheme unlock record levels of investment in Australia's energy grid and get us on track to reach 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030,\" he will tell the Investor Group on Climate Change in a speech on Tuesday evening. \"We will be further expanding the CIS with a further 3 gigawatts of generation, enough to power more than 1 million households. \"We will also incentivise even more storage to come online. Through the CIS, we will underwrite an additional 5 GW of dispatchable capacity or storage. \"This is equivalent to supplying 4.6 million households in the National Electricity Market with energy at peak times, and will support an additional $21 billion in investment in dispatchable capacity.\" Kane Thornton, the retiring chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, has welcomed the federal government's announcement of extended support for renewables projects. Clean Energy Council CEO Kane Thornton is stepping down after more than a decade in the role. \"The Capacity Investment Scheme is playing a role today to support investment. It's clearly going to play a bigger role in coming years as the federal government leans into that as their preferred policy,\" he told The Business. \"I think we need to remember that throughout the course of history, almost every electricity generating plant in Australia was either built [or funded] by governments and that was certainly the case for many decades in Australia.\" Mr Thornton said that existing policies have seen a massive increase in renewable energy generation capacity and he believes Australia is on track to meet the Albanese government's target of 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030. \"We've essentially doubled the amount of renewable energy over the past five years,\" he said. However, speaking ahead of Mr Bowen's announcement, Professor Garnaut was critical that almost all new private grid-scale investment in solar and wind power was now underwritten by government. He said the combination of falling prices for solar and wind power, along with the sliding value of large generation certificates (LGCs) for renewable projects, meant that government subsidies like the CIS might no longer be as effective in attracting enough renewables investment. In fact, Professor Garnaut argued that they might be discouraging voluntary private sector investment. \"Announcement of the extended CIS was one of several Commonwealth policy and other changes that led to a slowing of voluntary commitments to use renewable energy. The election of President Trump in November 2024 has been the latest of these developments,\" he observed. The value of Large Generation Certificates has dropped, making investment in new renewables projects less profitable.(Supplied: Ross Garnaut) Speaking to the ABC after his speech, specifically about Mr Bowen's announcement, Professor Garnaut said the CIS would be a \"valuable addition to a carbon price\" but without a carbon price, there was a large risk that the federal government would end up on the hook for financially struggling renewables projects. \"If we are hugely expanding the CIS, if we're using the CIS as a main mechanism whereby we reach our targets and we don't have a carbon price, then the budget risks are large,\" he warned. Professor Garnaut instead urged the government to completely overhaul its carbon reduction strategy. \"There are limits to the progress that we can make towards Anthony Albanese objectives using Tony Abbott policies. These policies include the safeguard mechanism and heavy reliance on voluntary commitments to using renewable energy,\" he said. \"Australia now needs Anthony Albanese policies to achieve Anthony Albanese objectives.\" The eminent economist urged a return to the past to help Australia achieve a net zero emissions future at the lowest possible cost. \"The best cure in the national interest is a carbon price. Not by a little bit, but by a big margin,\" he argued. \"The carbon price greatly reduces contingent budget liabilities from the CIS and other underwriting schemes. \"In addition, it can add about 1 per cent of GDP or about $25 billion to government revenues, with only a small proportion being required to compensate households for increases in power prices.\" Ahead of the federal government's Economic Reform Roundtable next month, Professor Garnaut said that reintroducing some form of carbon price was a far better idea than increasing the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Treasury's mistaken release of advice that \"tax should be raised\" looks like a happy accident for a treasurer determined for major reform. \"Introduction of carbon pricing is the most economically efficient tax reform available to Australia at a time when we need budget repair,\" he told the audience. \"It delivers all of the economic advantages claimed for increases in GST by its advocates, with the additional advantage of increasing the efficiency of markets. \"The carbon price unleashes the innovation, dynamism and capital resources of competitive markets to build the transition. It efficiently reduces emissions through most of the economy and not only in electricity generation.\" If the politics of a carbon price are still too difficult, an alternative temporary fix suggested by Professor Garnaut would be to extend the federal government's Renewable Energy Target (RET). However, he argued it would not contribute to budget repair, nor to reducing emissions outside the electricity sector, and would ultimately need to be supplanted by carbon pricing \"well before 2050\". \"Apply neither of the remedies, and we are headed for energy and climate policy crisis within a few years, with demands from the energy sector contributing to severe budgetary problems,\" Professor Garnaut warned. In the absence of either, the economist warned that Australian consumers remained vulnerable to the \"oligopolistic\" behaviour of gas suppliers and big energy generators. \"Average gas power prices are now much higher than during the height of Ukraine disruption, despite gas commodity prices having fallen back,\" he observed. \"They have been driven to a considerable extent by the loosening of inhibitions in the use of oligopolistic power to lift prices. \"At times, gas generators reduced output when low renewable output was lifting market prices above the average.\" Gas generators are receiving far higher returns from electricity customers than solar and wind.(Supplied: Ross Garnaut) Professor Garnaut said a carbon price was the most technology-agnostic, efficient and equitable way to reduce emissions. \"All forms of energy and all ways of reducing emissions can compete on a level playing field,\" he argued. \"There is no need then for a climate trigger in environmental legislation. \"Nuclear power, which is genuinely zero emissions like solar and wind, gets the same advantage on climate grounds as wind or solar. Gas gets an advantage over coal because it does less climate damage. Leading economist Professor Ross Garnaut says Labor could seize on its thumping election win to revisit significant reforms such as the carbon price and mining tax. \"Geological carbon capture and storage is rewarded for its reductions in emissions at the same rate as renewable energy. So is sequestration of carbon in plants and soils.\" Professor Garnaut ended with this message to politicians of all political persuasions: \"Let's stop kidding ourselves in the 48th Parliament,\" he concluded. \"Let's start telling the truth. The truth is that early adoption of carbon pricing is in Australia's national interest, and needs to be considered as a matter of urgency.\"",

        "raw_text": "Before her responsibilities were effectively cut in half, Laura Kane was burdened with the most challenging role in football, spanning everything that was hard and controversial about managing the game. Much of the criticism she copped should have been directed at the people she was directly managing, as well as the people who hired her. Greg Swann\u2019s arrival atAFLHouse last Monday came with a sigh of relief. \u201cSwanny\u2019s a ripper\u201d and \u201cSwanny understands clubland\u201d must have been uttered dozens of times on radio, on podcasts and TV this past week. But even with a fraction of Kane\u2019s responsibilities, it remains one of the most demanding jobs in football. Swann is phlegmatic, he\u2019s a pragmatist and (so far) he\u2019s refreshingly free of weasel corporate-speak. Here are a few areas where he can make his mark. As football has become more professional, the umpiring department has not followed suit. There\u2019s never been more umpires on the field, there\u2019s never been more scrutiny on them, and there\u2019s never been more for them to do. Everything is magnified now. We\u2019re watching every game live, on large, high-definition televisions. Every game is replayed to within an inch of itself. But it\u2019s still officiated by part-timers who are barristers, accountants, teachers and public servants. There are clearly issues around depth, and the gap between the best and worst umpires is widening. They need to be better supported, paid, trained, instructed and led. It\u2019s one of the most critical issues the game faces. This is related to the first point. Umpires have to interpret and implement ever-changing and incomprehensible laws. The holding the ball rule is a mess. Ruck free kicks are bewildering. And there are 19 elements of the \u201cstand\u201d rule the poor buggers have to factor in. Swann was hired for his decisiveness and his ability to cut through red tape and he needs to prove his worth here. Swann was still in his Brisbane polo top when he lamented the length of games. Right now, the quarters are about four minutes too long. The average match length has increased by seven minutes over the past decade, and is up by more than two minutes on last season. There\u2019s lots of fat to trim. A good starting point would be to no longer wait for lumbering ruckmen to arrive to throw ups, and to not call for a score review every five minutes. On that note \u2026 It has affected finals games. It has cost teams top-eight spots. It has made goal umpires second guess themselves. And it sucks the air out of games. It would work, maybe, if it was used as sparingly as possible. It would work, maybe, if the technology was evenly remotely up to the task. Either invest in proper technology and have proper processes, or don\u2019t use it at all.

        "raw_text": "The hottest property in the AFL happens to have the coolest head in the game. St Kilda sensation Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera completed his sparkling rise from a damaging defender and one of the most exciting midfielders in the competition, to a proven match-winner after icingtwo goals in the final minute that sealed a historic comebackagainst Melbourne. The 22-year-old has already shown he can do it all at both ends. But it is rare for a player to have a game-changing impact in all areas of the field in one game, let alone in a single breathtaking quarter that helped turn Sunday\u2019s contest. Wanganeen-Milera started the game taking on the Demons\u2019 decorated on-ball brigade, but with the Saints trailing by 46 points at the final change he was soon taking the kick ins, connecting play through the midfield and drifting forward to be a target in attack. The defender-turned-allrounder gathered 10 disposals as the Saints came from the clouds to chase down the Demons in the final term. But it is Wanganeen-Milera\u2019s last minute of action at Marvel Stadium that will go down in folklore. It is a tale that even the humble Saints star struggled to explain. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m a bit speechless,\u201d Wanganeen-Milera told Channel 7 immediately after the game. \u201cIt just sort of happened, I flew for it. But my teammates did a great job in the last quarter, the pressure was unreal, we just kept fighting and fighting.\u201d The Demons led by a goal with less than a minute left on the clock when Saints midfielder Mason Wood received a handball after a boundary throw-in on the wing and bombed the ball into the forward 50. Wanganeen-Milera first made his name as a rebounding half-back and has shown plenty of promise since moving into the midfield, but with the game on the line he soared over Bailey Fritsch to pull down a screamer in front of Demons defender Judd McVee within sight of goal. The exquisitely skilled Wanganeen-Milera could hardly have split the middle better as he nailed the set shot to level the scores with only eight seconds remaining and leave the Saints looking like the only side thinking about victory. While the young St Kilda players were calm and composed amid the chaos that followed, even the most experienced Demons lost their heads as they turned the ball over with a 6-6-6 infringement for not having enough players set up in each area of the ground. The Saints trio of Rowan Marshall, Marcus Windhager and Wanganeen-Milera quickly concocted a plan at the centre bounce for the ruck to take the free kick and pick out the man of the moment charging forward. A pinpoint pass from Marshall was enough to find Wanganeen-Milera just inside the 50m arc as he bravely marked while falling backwards. He sprang back to his feet before the siren sounded. \u201cI just told the forwards, \u2018get out of my way\u2019, and then I told Rowan, \u2018just hit me on the left side\u2019, and it was lucky I got on the end of it,\u201d Wanganeen-Milera said. With the result resting on his young shoulders, Wanganeen-Milera only needed a point to clinch the greatest comeback from a three-quarter-time deficit in VFL/AFL history. It was no surprise to see his lethal right foot send the ball through the middle again for the icing on the cake of a stunning six-point triumph. Wanganeen-Milera finished with 34 disposals, nine score involvements, six clearances and a career-high four goals in just the latest display as his career keeps reaching for new heights.

I just said, \u2018how\u2019s Nas\u2019, he\u2019s pretty confident. Then I rang him, he goes, \u2018no, I\u2019ll be right\u2019.

The stepson of former St Kilda player Terry Milera and nephew of former Port Adelaide and Essendon great Gavin Wanganeen owns the most sought-after signature in the game, as he comes out of contract while being courted by both clubs in his home state of South Australia. Wanganeen-Milera has already ensured that St Kilda are etched in the record books for their fightback, but the club that drafted him at No 11 in 2021 AFL draft live in hope that his incredible performance against Melbourne was just one of many memorable moments to come in red, white and black.",

        "raw_text": "Temperamentally, it\u2019s hard to imagine two more different footballers than Jeremy Cameron and Matt Rowell. Cameron kicked 11 goals on the weekend, and slotted each one with the same leisurely air as when he\u2019s whacking golf balls into the lake on his farm. Rowell had 37 possessions, most of which were earned in a footballing form of hand-to-hand-combat. Rowell met considerably stiffer opposition than Cameron, whose bag came against a lamentable North Melbourne, a team that is driving its fans to despair. Rowell\u2019s 37 came against a crack midfield, with one of the sport\u2019s best two-way runners in his back pocket all afternoon. Rowell\u2019s motor often takes half a quarter or so to properly turn over. And Josh Dunkley, who has blanketed him in recent meetings, seemed to have his measure in the early minutes of the Queensland derby. He was doing all the right things \u2013 bumping him off balance, blocking him at stoppages and involving himself in possession chains. But in horseracing parlances, this was run on a Heavy 9 and Rowell is built for those conditions. He\u2019s low slung, incredibly strong through the glutes and legs, and excellent at holding his centre of gravity. Scrimmaging on his hands and knees \u2013 one of the more exhausting things you can do on a football field \u2013 he\u2019ll shovel out the handball at the fourth or fifth effort. For such a brute of a footballer, he also has fast feet and a recurring sight all afternoon was of him giving Dunkley the slip at stoppages \u2013 sometimes with twinkle toes, sometimes just sledgehammering his way out. It\u2019s impossible to write about Rowell and not mention Noah Anderson. The best friends are polar opposites as footballers. One pursues the ball in an almost demented manner. The other glides and slaloms his way through congestion. Anderson took a while to adapt to Damien Hardwick\u2019s ways. But he has been exceptional this year, and would be a worthy Brownlow medallist and All Australian captain. In a recent profile on theAFLwebsite, three people who coach and work with him compared him to Scott Pendlebury. Words like \u201ccalm\u201d and \u201cunfazed\u201d were peppered throughout the article. It\u2019s a shame he and Rowell aren\u2019t playing in front of 80,000 people every other week. But they drew their marbles, went where they were told and have made Gold Coast a serious football team. There are several things that stand out about the Suns. The first is how much they resemble Hardwick\u2019s great Richmond side just as it was about to pop \u2013 the frantic,raus rausfootball, the determination to attack from half back in great sweeping waves. Like Richmond\u2019s Tigers, and unlike any Suns side in its first dozen years, they don\u2019t drop their bundle after a bad loss. And there\u2019s finally a bit of mongrel about them, an attitude that GWS had right from the beginning but which the Suns failed to cultivate. A lot of them, including Rowell and ruckman Jarrod Witts, are prepared to do the dirty work, allowing thoroughbreds like Anderson the full expression of his game. Like Melbourne, they wined and dined all the prominent media figures in February. All the big movers and shakers were there \u2013 the president, the CEO, the coach, Anderson, Rowell and a lot of the best players. They were selling their story. They were asking for a fair ride from the media. And underpinning everything was a steely resolve that they weren\u2019t going to roll over for anyone any more. Sign up toFrom the Pocket: AFL Weekly Jonathan Horn brings expert analysis on the week's biggest AFL stories after newsletter promotion Yeah yeah, most probably thought, thanks for the dinner but we\u2019ve heard it all before. After all, this is the time of year where the Suns traditionally fall in a heap. In the last seven games of a season, they\u2019ve never won more than three of them. They had a poor recent record against Brisbane, they were towelled up by Adelaide last week and they were without Daniel Rioli and Touk Miller. But they took on a premiership midfield, a midfield with depth and variety and talent to burn, and they obliterated them. Their 12th win is the most they\u2019ve registered in a season. At the final break, in teeming rain, coach and players were squeezed in tight and grinning broadly. I\u2019ll take a stab and suggest Hardwick was saying something along the lines of \u201cHow good is this?\u201d and \u201cwe finally belong with the big boys\u201d. A final word on Rowell and Anderson. There\u2019s a photograph of them with Nick Daicos in the same school team in 2019. Pity the poor VCE students, concerned mainly with their studies, their social lives and playing a bit of footy on a Saturday, who had to try to quell that trio. The poor buggers should get a spot in the motorcade on grand final day. ",

        "raw_text": "The timing could not have been better for Todd Greenberg, the new chief executive of Cricket Australia. The month before he settled into his Jolimont office in March this year, his associates at the England and Wales Cricket Board did him an extraordinary favour. Their process to sell minority stakes in teams playing in The Hundred, the short-form franchise cricket competition similar to the Big Bash League,raised \u00a3520m ($1.06bn). Greenberg \u2013 the respected former NRL and Australian Cricketers\u2019 Association CEO \u2013 followed Nick Hockley in the role. But while the position as one of the figureheads of Australian sport came with prestige and power, Greenberg was also restricted by the actions of his predecessor. The extension of the local broadcast deal with Foxtel and Channel Seven was signed by Hockley in 2023 amid strained relations between the sport and its free-to-air partner. Whether the roughly $215m per year arrangement was fair value or not, Greenberg came into the role handcuffed: cricket\u2019s single biggest revenue line item was locked in until 2031. Seeking options \u2013 more so-called \u201cfinancial levers\u201d \u2013 at the start of his tenure as CEO, Greenberg acted quickly following the The Hundred sale process. Alongside chair Mike Baird, Greenberg commissioned CA\u2019s long-time consultants of choice, Boston Consulting Group, to assess the best paths of growth for the BBL. The recommendations of that report wererevealed on Tuesday in the Sydney Morning Herald, and include selling a minority stake in the eight BBL teams to private investors. Whether it came from a genuine leak, or a plant by CA to test public support for the controversial proposal, the news has been hailed by proponents of private investment. Cricket Australia addressed the speculation on Wednesday, confirming the recommendations included optimising the schedule and increasing the salary cap to attract top players, the potential for expansion, and private investment. Baird said although \u201cno decisions have yet been made\u201d, work is now under way alongside cricket, commercial and broadcast partners \u201cto consider the recommendations on how this value can be unlocked\u201d. Player agent and cricket dealmaker, Neil Maxwell, believes the opportunity not only provides access to capital but also new investors\u2019 business acumen and networks. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken this long,\u201d he says. \u201cThe BBL has built a decent product, initially it was a second mover [after the IPL], and it had that advantage over other leagues, but it set itself back by not keeping pace with commercial reality. The major factor there is it hasn\u2019t been able to compete internationally through one of the main products that people require, and that\u2019s access to the best players.\u201d Private equity in the BBL has been considered since 2010, before a ball in the new competition had been bowled. At that time, the CA\u2019s head of strategy was Andrew Jones, who now works as a management consultant. A decade later, Jones wrote an article in The Age describing the period titled: \u201cThere is always free cheese in a mousetrap\u201d. The \u201cfree cheese\u201d in a private equity deal is the up-front investment. The \u201cmousetrap\u201d is the money, control and strategic flexibility lost forever. Selling BBL stakes to private investors was \u201cthe single worst idea in my time in cricket,\u201d Jones wrote in 2021. \u201cNot much has changed.\u201d Since 2021 however, IPL team valuations continue to rise, and a sale of the Gujarat Titans this year pegs the team at around $1.3bn. There has been increasing investment in franchise T20 leagues such as those in South Africa and the UAE, which compete against the BBL in its traditional summer school holiday window. Eric Windholz, associate professor in Faculty of Law at Monash University and an expert in sports law says CA \u201cwould be derelict in their duties\u201d if they were not monitoring these global trends. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural that the authorities in charge of cricket in Australia are looking at what\u2019s happening around the world and properly investigating what are the opportunities for cricket here,\u201d he says. But he noted public sentiment remained sceptical about private equity\u2019s benefits. \u201cWe, the public, feel like we own the sport, so whenever we hear about private equity coming in to own an asset that we think we own, we obviously have an unease about it,\u201d he says. Sign up toThe Spin Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week\u2019s action after newsletter promotion Greenberg appeared to address those who might be uncomfortable with the notion with his comments on Wednesday, when he said \u201cany action we take achieves this potential and is in the best interests of Australian cricket and cricket fans\u201d. Some of that discomfort may be alleviated by the release of more information about the proposed BBL deals. Selling 49% of a franchise will be too large a share for some states to stomach, even if they retain majority control of an entity valued as high as six figures. The franchises will also require veto rights over the investors. The Adani Group, which had interest in the recent Gujarat Titans sale process, buying a stake in Brisbane Heat is unlikely to go down well. But there are also competing views over how any capital injection would be spent. Under The Hundred\u2019s sale, 10% of the revenue was quarantined for grassroots cricket, with the rest split between the counties and the MCC. Much of that money appears set to be used to prevent the collapse of some counties, andreduce hundreds of millions of pounds in debt. Cricket Australia lost $32m in 2023-24, but its cash reserves are set to riseto around $70m after the coming Ashes Tour, largely thanks to the success of red ball cricket. At this stage at least, the sport doesn\u2019t need external funding to help prop it up. Some within cricket believe a proportion of any private equity windfall should be placed in a so-called \u201cfuture fund\u201d to deliver market returns long into the future, or to provide security for the next pandemic. Some look at the diversified assets of the NRL, which has bought into real estate in recent years, with envy. Others have raised the prospect of infrastructure upgrades within the sport. All agree that at least some needs to be spent on the BBL, to attract more prominent players and improve its global standing. Yet there is concern that cricket\u2019s diverse stakeholders may make competing claims on any newfound riches, and turn a once-in-a-lifetime investment injection into a short-term sugar hit. Maxwell, as a player agent, believes athletes must be better paid, but only as part of a broader plan for growth. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018pay the players and then build a strategy\u2019, it\u2019s the other way around,\u201d Maxwell says. \u201cThe players fill that gap and they support that strategy.\u201d Windholz agrees there are positives in having an injection of private capital, \u201cbut the owners of the private capital aren\u2019t doing this out of the goodness of their hearts,\u201d he says. \u201cThey want a return on their investment, and that\u2019s where the risk lies.\u201d",

Wellington Phoenix announced Wednesday that Priestman would take over as head coach of their women\u2019s team, returning to football in the country she was banned forspying on with a drone, New Zealand. She has signed a two-year contract. The 39-year-old was visibly emotional as she discussed her suspension, and how nervous she is to be returning to the sport. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel safe,\u201d Priestman said of living in Canada after the Olympics. \u201cThat\u2019s being brutally honest. It was very difficult for my family, and I have to live with that. \u201cObviously it was an absolute media frenzy. You\u2019ve got people knocking at your door and everything, and I\u2019ve got a little boy. Without going into too much detail, it was very difficult. We knew we had to get out of that country.\u201d Fifa banned Priestman for one yearafter her coaching team used a drone to snoop on New Zealand before they played at the Paris Games. New Zealand had spotted drones flying over their training sessions before their opening match and reported it to officials. An investigation found the Canadian team had been spying on rival training sessions for some time. Priestman said she is prevented from speaking about the situation in detail, due to ongoing legal discussions. But on her return to New Zealand she said she had talked to players and officials. She said the move to Wellington was an opportunity to \u201creset\u201d her career, and rebuild. On Tuesday night, hours after her ban was lifted, she ran her first coaching session in more than a year. \u201cI celebrated last night coaching the under-7s, my son\u2019s team, in the pouring Wellington rain,\u201d Priestman said. \u201cThat was a nice, humbling experience.

She said she had learned from her ban, and her experience with Canada, and would be a better coach for it. \u201cThere\u2019s certain values that I hold and unfortunately, you know, things around me have clouded my judgement,\u201d Priestman said. \u201cSo for me personally, I just want to get back to... I love working with people. I love getting the best out of people. I love being on a football pitch. \u201cI just want to create a special moment for this city, for this country and move forward.\u201d Wellington Phoenix chairman Rob Morrison said he was \u201creally pleased to be able to welcome Bev back to football\u201d. \u201cWe all know she\u2019s had a period of time away from the game, but we understand the circumstances and we\u2019re really comfortable with this appointment.

        "raw_text": "The Wallabies were brave in Melbourne but the true test of their courage comes now. Despite snatching defeat from the jaws of victory yet again, they must try to put aside the disappointment of thelast-gasp 29-26 defeat at the MCGand debate over thatcontentious 80th minute non-penalty, and win the final Test to deny the Lions a 3-0 sweep. The Wallabies can\u2019t save the series but they can save face in Sydney on Saturday \u2013 and claw back a little of thegoodwill they squandered in letting the Lions off the hookwith 90,307 fans in the stands and millions more watching on screens at home. It won\u2019t be easy. All weekAustralians have torn themselvesapart wrestling with one of the crueller defeats in the Wallabies\u2019 woebegone recent history. Moods have swung between grieving and aggrieved, despair and defiance. On one hand the wider public are mourning a gut-wrenching defeat, a once-every-12-years opportunity lost amid an embarrassing, yet painfully familiar, inability to ruthlessly close outa game they were bossing with a 23-5 lead. On the other hand they are still aggrieved that Australia\u2019s early dominance over the Lions wasdenied at the death by a 50-50 decision. Carlo Tizzano\u2019s theatrics \u2013 reeling from the contact with operatic passion, hands clutching the back of his head in mock-agony \u2013 have also polarised. Was this cowardly \u201cdiving\u201d or canny gamesmanship to catch the camera\u2019s eye? Alas, Italian referee Andrea Piardi sang only from the song sheet of officialdom. He ignored Tizzano\u2019s squatter\u2019s rights to the ball in the ruck to reward Jac Morgan\u2019s lethal clean-out a split second later. In the chaos, the Wallabies lost possession. The Lions cleared to the left and found space for Hugo Keenan to scramble over the line. Game over. Series won \u2013 and lost. For Wallabies fans who have endured a torrid two decades of decline, it was another cruel blow. But not an undeserving one. Australia had tempted the fates when young fly-half Tom Lynagh coughed up a kick under no pressure to spark two Lions tries that saw Australia\u2019s 18-point ascendancy vanish into a slender six-point buffer at the break. Yes, Piardi\u2019s decision had denied Australia a penalty that would\u2019ve secured victory and squared the series one-all. But sport is built on drama, not justice. Rugby clings to respect for the referee as sacrosanct. Both captains Harry Wilson and Maro Itoje addressed Piardi as \u201csir\u201d throughout (even though the honorary title often gets lost in a torrent of profanity afterwards). For all its wine-producing and guzzling, sour grapes are not Australia\u2019s go. This, after all, is the land of \u201ccop it sweet\u201d. The real cost for the Wallabies was bottling a golden chance to win back floating fans with a famous victory at the nation\u2019s most storied colosseum. With a World Cup to host in 2027, Australian rugby badly needed a boilover victory against an all-star touring side to give Joe Schmidt\u2019s ragged band of players a jolt of confidence before another arduous Rugby Championship against the All Blacks, South Africa and Argentina starting on 17 August. Instead, the opportunity for a week of fever pitch anticipation for a decider before more than 80,000 fans at the former Olympic stadium has been lost. Worse, the largely self-inflicted calamity in Melbourne has reopened old wounds of other near-victories cruelly vaporised \u2013 Kurtley Beale slipping in the mud to gift the 2013 Lions their first series win in 16 years, Bernard Foley penalised for time wasting when the Wallabies had the All Blacks on the rack in 2022.

        "raw_text": "World Rugby officials have called for greater respect to be shown towards referees following the furore over the pivotal late call in Saturday\u2019s second Test between Australia and the British & Irish Lions. Alan Gilpin, World Rugby\u2019s chief executive, believes the mental health of match officials needs prioritising and has describedthe post-game outburst by the Wallabies coach, Joe Schmidt, as\u201cdisappointing\u201d. The call by the Italian referee Andre Piardi to allow the Lions\u2019 match-clinching late score was criticised by Schmidt, who was unhappy with the decision not to penalise Jac Morgan for a clear-out just prior to Hugo Keenan\u2019s try. A routine post-match review of the officiating is continuing but Gilpin says public criticism of match officials is unfair on those at the sharp end. \u201cWe\u2019ve got match officials who, when they\u2019re criticised publicly, are having their families targeted outside the school gates,\u201d said Gilpin, all too aware of the external pressure to which referees can now be subjected. \u201cThat\u2019s not good, that\u2019s not fair, and that\u2019s not right, so we\u2019ve got to support these guys.\u201d World Rugby\u2019s chairman, Brett Robinson, is similarly concerned and says Nic Berry, the referee whose performance was criticised by the Springboks coach, Rassie Erasmus, on the previous Lions tour in 2021, is still suffering from the after-effects. \u201cNic Berry is a mate of mine from Brisbane and he got absolutely hammered in the last Lions series in South Africa,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cYou talk to Nic today and he is still incredibly scarred by the abuse and trolling that happened to him. This [latest episode] reinforces why we have to protect our officials. The sport needs to respect them. Without these people turning up every week we don\u2019t have a game.\u201d World Rugby has no plans to release the outcome of their post-game review but Schmidt is set to avoid any sanction for his comments despite publicly suggesting that failing to penalise Morgan for making contact with the neck of Carlo Tizzano undermined the game\u2019s stated aim of prioritising player welfare. \u201cI think it is disappointing when the reaction is, \u2018this means player welfare isn\u2019t taken seriously\u2019, because we have worked really hard on that narrative,\u201d said Gilpin. \u201cEveryone knows we are putting player welfare, in its broadest sense, at the top of the agenda. \u201cI think Joe ... there\u2019s a lot of emotion, understandably. The Wallabies had a chance to win an amazing Test match [and] Joe\u2019s comments have continued to respect the fact that the match officials have got a tough job to do. He might disagree with the decisions that were made, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s called the integrity of our match officials into question.\u201d Gilpin confirmed, however, that the outcome of the review process would not be made public despite widespread public interest. \u201cWe won\u2019t talk publicly about that decision. The decision\u2019s happened, the game\u2019s finished, we\u2019ll move on. [But] we\u2019ll share with Joe and the coaching team why the match official has made that decision. Joe\u2019s got a view about what was wrong with that decision and there\u2019ll be a debate about that, so that Joe and his players can go into the next Test understanding how that game\u2019s going to be officiated. Sign up toThe Breakdown The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed after newsletter promotion \u201cWe are reviewing the way the game is officiated and played all the time. We\u2019ll continue to work really hard with the match officials group to get consistency in the way key areas are officiated and, hopefully, that provides clarity to players and coaches. But like in any high-level sport, coaches are always looking for an edge with their teams, and we respect that.\u201d World Rugby also say they are still awaiting further details regardingthe mooted R360 rebel league, whose backers are currently attempting to woo the world\u2019s leading players. \u201cInvestment into the game is great \u2013 as long as that investment is driving into the right areas,\u201d said Gilpin. \u201cIf it is creating a more financially sustainable game for players and for the wider ecosystem then we encourage it. We\u2019ve got to understand what that means in the R360 case.\u201d He is also hopeful that an update regarding the new Nations Cup tournament set to commence in 2026 will finally be forthcoming next month. \u201cWe\u2019re at the stage now where for a competition that\u2019s going to start next July we\u2019ve got to get this thing nailed down,\u201d Gilpin said.

In better news for Farrell, Joe McCarthy, Mack Hansen and Sione Tuipulotu all took a full part in training on Tuesday and are in contention. Farrell sought to blow off any lingering cobwebs from the second-Test celebrations with a Squid Game challenge at the start of training.

        "raw_text": "What a richly rewarding few weeks it has been for the British & Irish Lions. Since their training camp in Portugal and pre-departure week in Ireland they have crisscrossed Australia and sampled the contrasting delights of Perth, Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra, Adelaide and Melbourne. Winning the series was the squad\u2019s primary objective but they have been actively encouraged to enjoy their time on tour, too. A Lions expedition is not just about what happens on the field. Henry Pollock, Duhan van der Merwe and Josh van der Flier have been to the Great Barrier Reef while Pierre Schoeman has been writing poetry. Others have headed to the golf course or strolled the beaches of Bondi and Coogee with their families. The squad\u2019s eight games in Australia to date have whizzed past but the players will still return home with plenty of non\u2011rugby memories. The best-of-three format has also yielded some absorbing storylines, despite the Lions\u2019 2-0 advantage heading into the final Test this weekend. How many would have guessed at half-time in the first Test in Brisbane, for example, that the Lions would be23-5 down after half an hourthe following week in Melbourne? Or that the Wallabies could be so transformed in the space of just eight days? It is the beauty of an old-school series. What happened last Saturday will not necessarily pertain to this week. There will be ebb and flow and, by the end, the players\u2019 strengths and weaknesses will have been more fully revealed. So, too, the coaches\u2019 ability to change the picture. Even in defeat, the Wallabies\u2019 first\u2011half display was testament to Joe Schmidt\u2019s tactical nous. Look at the difference that Rob Valetini and Will Skelton made having sat out the first Test. After a quiet game in Brisbane, Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii gave everyone a glimpse of why he is so highly rated. The Lions, for their part, stayed calm when it mattered with their half-backs calling the shots while Hugo Keenan, struck down by illness in the early stages of the tour, did brilliantly to deliver the coup de grace. A tour, in short, has an infinitely more varied, deeper narrative than a standalone Test week. If a northern hemisphere team win a series down south it also has a wider context. Until now the Lions had managed just one series victory since 1997. That gives their achievement here more resonance than, say, a one-off Test involving a team who have only popped in for a week. Hence the reason why not everyone is turning cartwheels at the idea of the new Nations Championship which is scheduled to kick off next year. Instead of the traditional touring arrangements, the six leading European sides will play the top five sides from the southern hemisphere plus Japan. To use England as an example, they are scheduled to have August games againstFiji, South Africa and Argentinain 2026 and then play November Tests against New Zealand, Australia and Japan. At least one head coach of a major nation hates the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t like it at all,\u201d he told me this year, citing the extra travel involved for many teams. Maybe if his side wins the Nations Championship final, set for London next year, Doha in 2028 and New York in 2030, he will change his view but, for now, the jury is very definitely out. The Guardian also understands Fiji\u2019s mooted \u201chome\u201d games next year against England, Wales and Scotland will be played in Europe to ensure more money for the Pacific Island side. That adds up in terms of their longer\u2011term financial future but kills stone-dead the romantic notion of taking the touring road less travelled. England have not played in Fiji since 1991 and New Zealand have still never played a full-capped international there. At least there continue to be a few pockets of hope, with South Africa and New Zealand having agreed to resume hosting \u201cproper\u201d tours in each other\u2019s countries. Next year the All Blacks are scheduled to head to South Africa for an eight-game trip including three Tests, marking the 30th anniversary of the last traditional tour between the two nations in 1996 when the All Blacks defeated the Springboks 2-1. A reciprocal tour is planned in New Zealand in 2030 with both unions clearly keen to replicate the kind of model that continues to be so successful for the Lions. And with the Lions to travel to face the All Blacks in 2029 and, theoretically, South Africa in 2033 there is clearly still financial mileage in touring if the teams involved are sufficiently box office and the games suitably competitive. Which is another reason why the match last Saturday was significant for Australia. Tim Horan, the great former Wallaby centre, called it \u201cthe most important Test match for the Wallabies since the 2015 World Cup final\u201d, not just in terms of the result but the team\u2019s ability toreconnect with the nation. Ultimately Australia did not get the result they wanted but clawed back a good deal of respect. They now need to do the same again in Sydney to sidestep a dispiriting 3-0 clean sweep. A 2-1 outcome would unquestionably be a better bargaining chip when the time comes to start negotiating over whether the Lions will return to Australia in 2037 as per the existing tour rota. That is because the other ingredient that makes touring special \u2013 besides the off-field fun and camaraderie \u2013 is the intensity of the midweek games. It was only in Melbourne in week five that any real matchday jeopardy emerged on this Lions tour, courtesy of theFirst Nations & Pasifika XVand then the Wallabies. There are plenty who believe France would offer a more compelling fixture list and a spectacular tour experience.

        "raw_text": "As Tameka Yallop unfurled the purple scroll revealing the Matildas\u2019 final group-stage opponent for next year\u2019s Asian Cup, whispers rustled across the Sydney Town Hall crowd. South Korea. The same team that had knocked them out of the quarter-final of this tournamentalmost four years ago. The game that plunged Australian football fans and media into despair. Memories of India came rushing back. Furious calls for head coach sackings underlinedwidespread astonishmentand growing concern over the direction of the team with a World Cup on the horizon. The Matildas were, after all, close to full-strength then. Sam Kerr and Caitlin Foord were reaching their attacking peaks, Mary Fowler was emerging as Australia\u2019s newest star, Ellie Carpenter and Steph Catley were at their flying wing-back best, Lydia Williams was still Australia\u2019s No 1 goalkeeper. They were expected to win the Asian Cup in 2022. Do we feel the same way now? Australia is a very different team to what they were the last time they competed for this trophy. Their fundamental core has shifted. Injuries and retirements have forced the side to figure out the next version of themselves, and nobody is quite sure what it looks like yet. Partly because the past 12 months under interim coach Tom Sermanni, the last coach to win this tournament for Australia back in 2010, was a year of stasis. With Football Australia taking far too long to appoint a successor to Tony Gustavsson, the team wasted several windows trotting out their tired senior players for friendlies when they should have been blooding the next generation instead. So who are the Matildas now? They\u2019ve lost some older players, gained some newer ones. The form of some key figureheads \u2013 Kerr, Fowler, Katrina Gorry \u2013 remains uncertain. The team\u2019s recent performances haven\u2019t been convincing. Are they any better or any worse than they were four years ago? Just how quickly has Asia improved around them? Joe Montemurro, whotook charge of his first campearlier this month, now has just three windows left to figure it out. And they will have the hot spotlight of the nation upon them as they try to solve their past problems against the hardest group of the tournament. Their opening match against the Philippines in Perth on 1 March may seem like an easy one on paper. Australia have won all their previous matches, including an 8-0 drubbing in October 2023. But this is a nation with a plan: led by Australian Mark Torcaso, the Filipinas are full of international diaspora, particularly from the USA college system. Their gallant World Cup performances, an ever-improving youth pipeline, and a large fan community could prove trickier than anticipated. Iran, too \u2013 the lowest-ranked side in the group \u2013 are no push-overs. While the Matildas have met them just once, Iran defended brilliantly and kept them to just a 2-0 win. Their defeat of rising Asian nation, Jordan, in the final round of qualifiers shows a side steadily improving, and knowing Australia\u2019s age-old struggle to break down deep-lying defensive teams, could pose a problem. Sign up toMoving the Goalposts No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women\u2019s football after newsletter promotion But it\u2019s South Korea that will cause the most concern. Never mind that the Matildasdefeated themin two friendlies back in April; tournament football is a different fight, and South Korea, who reached the final in 2022 before losing to China, know how to grind through them. The shadow of India will stretch across this must-win group game. South Korea is also a nation that is moving on. Just three of their most recent call-ups have had over 100 caps, while half their current squad is aged below 25. That includes 21-year-old striker Jeon Yu-Gyeong, who stood alongside the 34-year-old Yallop on stage at last night\u2019s draw. Two players representing two very different moments for their national teams. Australia aren\u2019t without their glimpses of the future, though. Amy Sayer, Winonah Heatley, Teagan Micah, Charlie Grant, Jamilla Rankin and Holly McNamara have all begun to show their qualities in the vacuum of senior stars. And squad depth \u2013 as we\u2019ve seen in the recent Women\u2019s Euro \u2013 could be critical to topping the group, thus avoiding some of Asia\u2019s biggest nations until World Cup qualification (which this tournament doubles as for the final time) is secured in the semi-finals. But with time slipping away and the Matildas\u2019 older core needing to reintegrate following a period of directionless wandering, is there enough time to do what needs to be done? Next year\u2019s Asian Cup will be a lot of things. A television spectacle, a commercial achievement, a moment in sporting history. It will also be a crucial litmus test; a chance to see just how far the Matildas have come \u2013 or, if the ghosts of their past still haunt them, how much further they have to go.",

With Australia hosting the tournament in March, the draw was made at Sydney Town Hall on Tuesday night. Joe Montemurro\u2019s team will host the opener against the Philippines at Perth\u2019s Optus Stadium on 1 March, and then take on Iran at Cbus Super Stadium on the Gold Coast on 5 March. The Matildas then face the toughest task with the final group match against South Korea at Sydney\u2019s Accor Stadium on 8 March. Montemurro\u2019s side avoided a group stage meeting with the defending champions China, who were drawn in Group B. The world No 7 team, Japan, the highest-ranked in the tournament, were drawn in Group C. \u201cIn any tournament, the expectations were what they were,\u201d Montemurro said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t predict that I wanted this team or that team. Now it\u2019s a little bit clearer, the style of teams we\u2019re playing, and it\u2019s a little bit clearer on how we approach the build-up into it.\u201d Looking to repeat their 2010 trophy run, the Matildas - ranked world No 15 \u2013 have just two international windows to find their feet under Montemurro before the Asian Cup. Australia netted two wins, a draw and a loss against Slovenia and Panama in their first batch of friendlies under Montemurro. The Matildas were lucky to escape with anerror-riddled 3-0 winover world No 38 Slovenia, and followed it up with a1-1 drawagainst the same team. With a handful of players departing halfway through the window, Australia then slumped to ashock 1-0 loss to world No 56 Panamabefore pulling off a 3-2 comeback win in the second match. Australia did not play China in the last Asian Cup in India, but suffered a shock 1-0 quarter-final loss to South Korea. The Matildas have since defeated South Korea, claiming a clean sweep of their two-game friendly series in May without conceding a goal. Still, Montemurro expects the heartache of their 2022 defeat still lingers for the players.

We\u2019ve got the crowd behind us.\u201d Australia are one of 12 teams split across three groups to have qualified for next year\u2019s tournament, which will culminate in the final at Accor Stadium on 21 March.

        "raw_text": "Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum have brought a clear, aggressive mindset to England over the past three years, an approach that has been hugely positive, freeing up the players and bringing a lot of excitement. But if they have decided to focus on winning games and entertaining the public, and chosen not to play for draws or focus on individual milestones, it does not mean everyone else has. Centuries are still important to players. Sometimes a draw is a positive result. What we saw from England when India initially refused to accept the draw on Sunday was a combination of natural disappointment \u2013 they had dominated the game, played so much good cricket, wanted to force home the advantage and make the final Test a dead rubber \u2013 genuine tiredness and a bit of cultural insensitivity. Certain situations are viewed differently around the world. Remember theJonny Bairstow incident at Lord\u2019sduring the 2023 Ashes, orRavi Ashwin running out Jos Buttlerat the non-striker\u2019s end in the 2019 Indian Premier League? The way those things were viewed in the UK and abroad was very different. I know from my time in county cricket that most teams would have walked off, even if they had a couple of batters approaching centuries, but in international cricket it is different \u2013 centuries mean more. In 2008, I was playing for Surrey against Somerset in the County Championship at Taunton. The wicket was very flat, one day was completely rained off and at the point the game was petering into a draw I was on about 190. The players started shaking hands but Justin Langer, the Australia opener who was the Somerset captain at the time, stopped everyone and said: \u201cWe\u2019re staying on \u2013 either we get Mark out or he gets a double hundred.\u201d The game ended a few minutes later when I reached 200. Justin had recognised, even though I was playing for the opposition, there was a milestone a batter had worked hard to earn. It is not as if the English completely ignore individual achievements. In the same Test we had been happy to celebrate Joe Root\u2019s, when he becamethe second-highest Test run-scorer. Graham Gooch, Alastair Cook and Jimmy Anderson have spoken of their pride at achieving milestones. I would hope and expect that if a young England player in search of their maiden Test century were 90 not out, their captain would be aware of that moment. To achieve that is a huge thing in someone\u2019s life, there is no guarantee they will be in that situation again, and the confidence it gives them can be huge. Some of the comments captured on the stump microphone did not reflect well on England. They played some magnificent cricket and dominated the game, butthat petulanceseems to have overshadowed it. I hope the ending will have taught them a couple of important lessons, about respecting other teams\u2019 cultures and other players\u2019 ambitions and the real value of a draw. McCullum and Stokes may have no interest in them, but in a five-Test series between two evenly matched teams there are likely to be times when one of them has to fight to save a game and a draw becomes a result to be celebrated. It takes me back to England and South Africa in 1998, when Angus Fraser blocked out Allan Donald in the last over for a draw when we had been completely outplayed to keep the score at 0-1. We were massively buoyed up by that result and went on to win the last two Tests to take the series. For the final game starting on Thursday the contest is still alive. All the pitches have been pretty flat, but the signature at the Oval, certainly at domestic level, is a good wicket with some grass still on it. Gus Atkinson has not played a lot recently but there is a strong argument for bringing him in. He should get a bit of extra movement on his home ground. England will need to decide the makeup of their attack not just based on the quality of their bowlers, but on their fragility and how they are dealing with fatigue. People of my generation struggle to understand why, if someone is fit to play, you would not play him. This is a huge game, against huge opponents, with the series on the line. The idea of resting and rotating fit players is puzzling to me: they have bowled a lot of overs, but there is a game to win. The big question is the captain because England cannot afford for Stokes to go bust. So their three seamers have to be bankers who can be relied on to bowl a lot of overs. At Old Trafford, the lack of penetration from Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse, particularly when the ball was hard and there was a bit of uneven bounce, was surprising. Liam Dawson was tidy, but I thought he would create a few more problems. Beyond Stokes and Root, the two to emerge with credit were Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley. India never recovered from the way the openers took the attack to them. They are a pair who live by the sword and die by the sword, but we saw how hard it was to bowl to them and how even very good teams struggle to stop them scoring once they slip into gear. People are very quick to leap upon their failures, but we should also savour their successes.",

Lots of great races over the years.\u201d Ledecky was ahead of her world-record pace through 1,250 meters, pushed early by Pallister. It was Ledecky\u2019s second medal in these games after taking bronze in the 400 free behind Canadian Summer McIntosh. The numbers speak to Ledecky\u2019s dominance, the most decorated female swimmer in history who has been on top for more than a decade. With Tuesday\u2019s swim she now owns 25 of the top 26 times in history in the 1,500. Her time Tuesday was the fifth fastest, not far off her world record of 15:20.48 set in 2018. It was her 22nd gold medal in a world championships and her 28th overall. Add to that nine Olympic gold medals and 14 overall. If you\u2019re not counting, that\u2019s 42 Olympic and world medals \u2013 31 gold. Watching from the stands was new International Olympic Committee President Kirsty Coventry. She was joined by former president Thomas Bach. Coventry was an Olympic gold-medal winner for Zimbabwe in 2004 and 2008 in the 200-meter backstroke.

But I\u2019m really proud of our team, our medical staff working overtime. You don\u2019t want your medical staff working overtime.\u201d \u201cIf you were in our team area you would never know that the overall majority of the team has gone through something over the last few days,\u201d Meehan added, saying the team \u201cvibe\u201d was good. McIntosh, who won two gold medals the first two days, did not race on Tuesday, Day 3 of the competition. She will face Ledecky in the 800, maybe the most anticipated race of the worlds. Paris Olympic champion David Popovici of Romania won the 200-meter freestyle, overtaking American Luke Hobson in the last 50 meters for the victory. Popovici swam 1:43.53 with Hobson across in 1:43.84. Tatsuya Murasa of Japan was third in 1:44.54. \u201cI think it was better than the Olympics to be honest,\u201d Popovici said of the victory. \u201cYou know why? Because I trained a lot for the Olympics. But this coming for a more relaxed year, easygoing year after the Olympics. I don\u2019t know. I feel very proud of myself.\u201d Kaylee McKeown of Australia took the women\u2019s 100-meter backstroke, closing over the last 50 to beat American Regan Smith. McKeown finished in 57.16 \u2013 just .03 off the world record held by Smith. Smith finished in 57.35 with bronze for American Katharine Berkoff in 58.15. McKeown is the two-time defending Olympic champion in this race and also in the 200 backstroke. She also beat Smith a year ago in Paris with Smith taking silver. Pieter Coetze of South Africa represents a new wave of contenders with the 21-year-old winning the men\u2019s 100 backstroke in 51.85 seconds. Thomas Ceccon of Italy took silver in 51.90, with bronze for Yohann Ndoye-Brouard in 51.92. Ceccon is the world record-holder in 51.60. In the last final of the night, Anna Elendt of Germany \u2013 swimming from Lane 1 \u2013 took the women\u2019s 100-meter breaststroke in 1:05.19. American Kate Douglass took silver in 1:05.27, with bronze for Tang Qianting of China in 1:05.64. \u201cI am so speechless,\u201d Elendt said. Germany has been piling it on. Lukas Martens took gold on Sunday in the 400 free. Florian Wellbrock also won four gold medals in the open-water events which took place earlier in the championships. In the semi-finals, Luca Urlando of the United States was the top qualifier in the 200 fly (1:52.84), teammate Claire Weinstein led the women\u2019s 200 free (1:54.69), and China\u2019s Qin Haiyang led the 50 breaststroke (26.52). Ahmed Jaouadi of Tunisia was quickest in the 800 free in morning prelims (7:41.58).",

        "raw_text": "The spicy spats that have increasingly been a feature in the England\u2011India Tests this summer spilled over to training on Tuesday when the tourists\u2019 head coach, Gautam Gambhir, had a row with Lee Fortis, Surrey\u2019s head groundkeeper, as his team prepared for the final Test of the series starting on Thursday at the Oval. England were enjoying a break but, with the series still to be decided and India 2-1 downafter their fightbackat Old Trafford, the visitors\u2019 work in the nets was far from straightforward as tensions surfaced in angry exchanges. Reports suggest that Fortis was unhappy with India using parts of the main square and was told \u201cyou can\u2019t tell us what to do\u201d. Sitanshu Kotak, the India batting coach, apparently accused the head groundkeeper of being \u201ca bit arrogant\u201d and shouting at members of India\u2019s staff. Gambhir, who played 58 Tests for India, was seen on camera wagging his finger at Fortis saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t tell us what to do \u2026 you\u2019re just the groundsman, nothing beyond.\u201d After walking away in conversation with Kotak, who appeared to take on the role of mediator, Fortis told Gambhir that he may be forced to lodge a complaint against him, drawing a response of: \u201cYou can go and report to whoever you want.\u201d Afterwards, Fortis said: \u201cIt is quite a big game coming up. It is not my job to be happy with [Gautam Gambhir] or not. I have never met him before today. You saw what he was like this morning. It\u2019s OK, I am fine. We have nothing to hide.\u201d Kotak said Fortis\u2019s objections to a cool box being wheeled on to the square kicked off the arguments. \u201cHe was sitting on the roller, he shouted and told the support staff not to take it there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is good to be a little possessive and it is also good to be protective, but not that much. Gautam just said do not talk to the support staff like this. \u201cMost of the team knows that the curator is not the easiest person to get on with. So, that gives a lot of answers. When you\u2019re working with very intelligent and highly skilled people, if you sound a bit arrogant or if you come across like \u2026 you can be protective. At the end of the day it is a cricket pitch. It is not an antique where you can\u2019t touch.\u201d Whether India\u2019s frustrations included concerns over the Test pitch as well as their training provisions is not known, but the Oval deck is expected to carry some live grass at the start of the game and provide greater pace and bounce than in the previous three matches. Sign up toThe Spin Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week\u2019s action after newsletter promotion The England attack has struggled for cut-through at times, not least inthe last innings of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, where they took four wickets in 143 overs. India\u2019s rearguard action ended in rancour, with Ben Stokes annoyed that Washington Sundar and Ravindra Jadeja declined his offer of an early handshake as they pursued centuries. Both batters reached three figures, but did so with some persistent sledging from England fielders. Relations between the teams had been relatively serene until atime\u2011wasting row at the third Testat Lord\u2019s, where Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett were treated to some choice words from the India captain, Shubman Gill. England responded by accusing Gill of running down the clock during his own innings and Mohammed Siraj was fined for his send-off of Duckett the next morning, though a brief shoulder-to-shoulder contact between the two players was accepted as accidental.",

        "raw_text": "Australia completed a flawless tour of the Caribbean with a three-wicket victory over West Indies in the fifth T20 to seal a series sweep in St Kitts. For the fifth time in as many matches, Australia won the toss and elected to bowl first, then restricted the West Indies to 170 and their lowest total in the series. The white-ball sweep comes after Australia also won all three Tests on the tour though they were given a scare as West Indies found their way through the deep middle-order that has largely proven the difference across the five T20s. Cameron Green, Tim David and Mitch Owen contributed valuable runs in the chase but it was left to Aaron Hardie (28 not out) to guide Australia to 173-7 with 18 balls remaining. Green (32 off 18) continued to build on his rich vein of form with a fourth significant innings before attempting to hit spinner Akeal Hosein (3-17) over the rope but picking out Matthew Forde at long-off. The young allrounder juggled the catch to give the home side a sniff before Hardie and Ben Dwarshuis (9) took control. Sean Abbott later helped complete the rout. David returned to the side and picked up where he left off after hammering a record-breaking 102 not out in the third match of the series. The powerful middle-order hitter blasted four sixes as he raced to 30 from 11 balls before finding Shimron Hetmyer on the leg side boundary off the bowling of Alzarri Joseph (2-21). Owen quickly took the mantle from David as he put together a third eye-catching knock in his debut series to press his claims for a longer-term place in the side. The 23-year-old compiled a controlled 37 while taking few risks before reaching for a wide delivery from Hosein and edging to Joseph at short third man. The only real blot for Australia was a golden duck for Glenn Maxwell as he opened for the fourth time in the series but immediately edged Jason Holder (2-36) while swinging hard outside off. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect 5-0 at the start of the series,\u201d Australia captain Mitch Marsh said. \u201cBut we played some great cricket and it was something we spoke about after the fourth game. \u201cWe\u2019ve had guys come in and played different roles for us. If you look down our batting order in all the five games, we had a lot of power and I guess the messaging was just to play their natural game.\u201d Marsh earlier called correctly as Australia won an eighth of eight tosses across two formats on the tour, and again elected to chase. A string of wickets early and late in the West Indies\u2019 innings meant the hosts were unable to post a big score on the small ground at Warner Park, Basseterre, before they were all out for 170 in the last over. Hetmyer (52 off 31) helped lift West Indies to a more competitive total before falling to a low running catch by Abbott at long-off. Sherfane Rutherford (35 off 17) also showed signs of good touch and smashed Abbott for a huge six before being bowled by Maxwell as he attempted to cut. Sign up toThe Spin Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week\u2019s action after newsletter promotion Left-arm quick Ben Dwarshuis (3-41) returned to the side and bowled Shai Hope after being struck for successive boundaries, then had Brandon King (11) caught at mid-on. Adam Zampa (1-20 off three) celebrated his 100th T20I by bowling Joseph in the 19th over, as the West Indies again failed to make the most of the closing overs and lost their last four wickets for 15 runs. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure in the last four overs, we didn\u2019t go for more than 40 or 50 across the five games,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to do. So I think all of them executed. Nathan Ellis was outstanding, Sean Abbott was brilliant. Ben Dwarshuis hasn\u2019t played a lot, did a really good role, and even Xavier Bartlett has grown and grown as a bowler.\u201d The victory sealed Australia\u2019s first 5-0 sweep in a T20I series, while the West Indies had never before gone winless across five matches in the format. Australia will seek to build on their imperious form in the Caribbean with six white-ball matches against South Africa on home turf next month bolstered by greater depth in their middle-order.",

        "raw_text": "Lorena Wiebes secured her second stage win in the 2025Tour de France Femmeson the Avenue John Kennedy in Poitiers, after again fending off her Dutch compatriot Marianne Vos in an uphill sprint. Wiebes, who also won the Italian classic Milan-San Remo and the the points classification in the Giro d\u2019Italia, described 2025 as her \u201cbest season to date\u201d. She has also won five Giro stages between from 2021-2025. \u201cI have tried to have more of a free mindset, like I had in the Giro,\u201d Wiebes, of Team SD Worx-Protime, said. \u201cThis season has already been really good, even if I hadn\u2019t won in theTour de France. It doesn\u2019t feel like we have a lot of pressure from the team.\u201d While Wiebes celebrated another sprint success, the pre-race favourite Demi Vollering was just happy to get through the day after aheavy crash close to the finish of stage threealmost ended her race. Vollering,winner of the 2023Tour de France Femmes, finished the stage in the main group, a feat which had looked unlikely before the start in Saumur, when she winced her way through a pre-race warm-up and was visibly in pain. \u201cIt was a big relief to feel good and that I was able to ride and to keep my head up,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest relief. From now on we will see, day by day. I was a bit anxious for the final because it was kind of similar to yesterday, so you feel tension. A crash like that takes its toll on you. Again, no time loss, and now I think the shock is over.\u201d Vollering admitted she had ridden at the front of the peloton \u201cmostly to stay safe \u2026 It\u2019s better to spend energy in the front of the peloton than be behind. My team did a very good job with keeping me in front of the bunch. When I was a bit anxious they were always next to me\u201d. The Dutch professional is the most high-value rider in the women\u2019s peloton and her \u20ac1m transfer to the French team FDJ-Suez was built around her winning this year\u2019s Tour. However, some rival teams were dismissive of comments by the FDJ-Suez team manager, Stephen Delcourt, about a lack of respect shown towards Vollering by others in the peloton, in the aftermath of her crash. \u201cWhat he\u2019s saying is ridiculous,\u201d Jos van Emden, the team director at Visma-Lease a bike, told Dutch media. \u201cApparently he wants a peloton of eight riders, with Demi in it, to ride in a gilded cage. He\u2019s simply been influenced by Demi, by Demi\u2019s posturing.\u201d This was Vollering\u2019s second high\u2011speed crash in the Tour, following her verysimilar fall in the race last year, six kilometres from the finish of stage four to Amn\u00e9ville, while wearing the yellow jersey. \u201cWhen I was on the ground I had some throwback of last year,\u201d she said, \u201cbut luckily this time it was in the five-kilometre rule [meaning she did not lose any time].\u201d However, she still blames her rivals for not honouring the tradition of waiting for the race leader when they are down, and her former teammates at SD Worx for racing ahead and abandoning her to her fate. This time, though, with Vollering\u2019s committed FDJ-Suez team around her, things were different. But it will still be a tall order for her to be fully recovered from what she described as a \u201chard impact\u201d for Wednesday\u2019s longest stage of the race, from Chasseneuil-du-Poitou Futuroscope to Gu\u00e9ret, which includes three categorised climbs in the final 35km.",

A motioncalling Israel\u2019s aid blockade of Gaza a breach of international lawand placing pressure on the Albanese government to ramp up pressure against Israel has passed the Senate this evening after Labor and the Greens teamed up. Following a pause for some first speeches in the upper house, the motion\u2019s speaker list resumed at 6pm with three more Greens senators and was agreed to on the voices by the remaining Labor and Greens senators in the chamber. The Coalition noted their disagreement but did not call for a division. The motion\u2019s final wording stated: Israel\u2019s aid blockade, which risks mass death from starvation in Gaza and millions of Palestinians facing catastrophic hunger, is a breach of international law, and that it is critical the Australian government continue intensifying its efforts including diplomatic and further action to pressure the Israeli government to open all border crossings and allow the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid. Labor Friends of Palestine: PM\u2019s comments belittling, misleading and disrespectful The Labor Friends of Palestine campaign group has criticisedAnthony Albanese\u2019scomments today downplaying the prospect of further sanctions on Israel over its military campaign in Gaza, saying his comments dismiss the sentiments of many inside the Labor movement. Asked at a press conference about levelling further sanctions on Israel, Albanese responded: \u201cWhat we haven\u2019t done is go for slogans, frankly \u2026 which is the sanction that you would like?\u201d The government has already put targeted financial and travel sanctions on two Israeli ministers. Albanese shrugged off further sanction calls, saying \u201cwhat we are about is meaningful action, not slogans\u201d. But many inside the Labor party are calling for sanctions. Victorian Labor\u2019s state conference will debate, and is expected to pass, a motion from rank-and-file members urging further sanctions on Israel and the recognition of the state of Palestine. Labor Friends of Palestine has circulated similar motions, supported by 80 (and climbing) local ALP branches. Peter Moss, co-convener of the Labor Friends of Palestine, said in a statement: The Prime Minister\u2019s comments today belittling the campaign for sanctions as \u2018slogans\u2019 are misleading and disrespectful to thousands of Labor Party members. The Prime Minister and the government are well aware of the overwhelming support for sanctions that are clearly defined in a motion passed by more than 80 Labor Party units in recent weeks. Labor Party members around Australia voted for \u2018sanctions on the Israeli individuals and entities who are responsible for ongoing breaches of international humanitarian law in Gaza, including the use of starvation as a weapon\u2019. The Prime Minister should not dismiss or distort the strongly held views of Labor Party members who worked hard for the re-election of his government. TheZionist Federation of Australiahas revealed it is \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the starvation crisis gripping Gaza and has urged Israel to ensure sufficient aid flows to Palestinian civilians \u201cwithout delay\u201d. The federation said it is the \u201ccollective moral obligation\u201d of Israel and the United Nations to address the humanitarian crisis in a statement on Wednesday, which was first reported by the Nine newspapers. The group\u2019s president,Jeremy Leibler, said: Our humanity also compels us to recognise the pain and suffering of innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza. We are deeply troubled by the reports of hunger in parts of Gaza. We call upon Israel, the United Nations and their counterparts to do everything within their power to ensure that sufficient humanitarian aid flows to Palestinian civilians without delay. That is their collective moral obligation. Leibler continued: We welcome that Israel is taking steps to facilitate the distribution of more aid, including undertaking daily pauses in its operations, and opening new aid corridors. We reiterate that ultimate responsibility for this humanitarian situation lies with Hamas \u2013 it started this war, refuses to release the hostages, refuses to accept a ceasefire agreement, deliberately steals aid to fund its war machine and sabotages its distribution. It is essential that Hamas returns to negotiations and accepts the hostage exchange and ceasefire agreement that is on the table, and ultimately, is removed from power in Gaza. Fate of plan to convert Queensland\u2019s Olympics villages into affordable housing uncertain Queensland\u2019s Olympics villages may not become affordable housing after the end of the games. Under the previous Labor government, a minimum of 20% of the athletes\u2019 villages were to be set aside as affordable housing. But parliamentary estimates heard on Wednesday that the new government had no specific target. The director general of state development, infrastructure and planning, John Sosso, said \u201cthe exact percentage will be a subject of negotiation\u201d but would \u201cplay an appropriate role in the housing stock\u201d. The deputy premier,Jarrod Bleijie, also revealed that the state government was considering selling the land beneath the Gabba cricket ground \u2013 which is set to be demolished \u2013 to fund the new 17,000-seat Brisbane live arena next door. He said: We would never say we would never say no to an arena if the private sector needs a deal to be done with the land. The one thing the state does have is the land. The one thing the state does have is the powers of planning and the levers to be pulled to unlock that infrastructure.

Police said emergency services were called at about 2pm to D-Block Road,Balranald, about 130km west of Hay, after reports of a light plane crash. A man, found in a critical condition, was treated by paramedics at the scene but could not be revived. The man, believed to be in his 50s, is yet to be formally identified, police said in a statement. Police said the crash site had been secured as a crime scene. A report will be prepared for the coroner and an investigation into the cause of the crash will be undertaken by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. Doctor turned politician and Israel ally says \u2018no words\u2019 to describe Gaza suffering The final speaker on the Greens\u2019 motion on Gaza isMichelle Ananda-Rajah, a Labor senator who visited Israel during her first term as a Labor MP in the previous parliament. Ananda-Rajah, a doctor turned politician, spoke of her experience in Israel after the 7 October attacks, describing it as \u201canother level of atrocity and depravity that I\u2019ve never experienced before\u201d. But the self-described ally of Israel said the situation in Gaza had \u201cdistressed\u201d her. She continued: Right now, the people of Gaza are suffering. There is a humanitarian catastrophe. There are no words left any more in our lexicon to describe what is going on there. It is unconscionable that children should be starving. It should be. It is unconscionable that pregnant mothers cannot deliver, that there is no anaesthesia, painfulness, insufficient antibiotics \u2026 Israel has, I should say, the Netanyahu government has really not articulated to the global community what the political solution is to this \u2026 Because not only are [the Netanyahu government] bringing Israel into disrepute, and further isolated, there is an unconscionable stain on this country\u2019s, I fear, history with the deaths of so many people disproportionately. And I say this as an ally of Israel. My Jewish community know who I am. They know how hard I fought for them, and I will continue to do so, but there must be a better solution to this conflict here. The motion\u2019s speeches were suspended while fresh senators delivered their first speeches. It\u2019ll resume later this evening. Lidia Thorpe: government \u2018has the power to take real action\u2019 on Gaza The independent senator,Lidia Thorpe, spoke to support the Greens\u2019 motion on Gaza, saying the crisis \u201cdidn\u2019t happen overnight\u201d despite the \u201csudden concern\u201d of the Albanese government. Each time this government stays silent, Israel is given the green light to carry on its genocide, knowing they can get away with it. Strongly worded emails and sharpened criticism of Israel\u2019s actions are not enough to hold Israel accountable. This government has the power to take real action and put an end to the mass murder of Palestinians. The Palestinian population is on the brink of complete annihilation as its genocide enters its final iteration, we demand urgent action before it\u2019s too late. Labor to move amendment to Greens\u2019 Gaza motion The Labor senatorTim Ayreshas spoken on the Greens\u2019 urgency motion, largely repeating comments made by the prime minister and foreign affairs minister previously. Ayres starts out by outlining the government\u2019s position: The position of the Australian government is very clear: every innocent life matters. We reiterate our call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire and the release of all of the remaining hostages. The government remains unequivocal in our condemnation of Hamas and its ongoing acts of terror. Gaza is in the grip of a humanitarian catastrophe. Israel\u2019s denial of aid and the killing of civilians, including children seeking access to water and food, is indefensible. We call on Israel to comply immediately with its obligations under international law. Labor will move an amendment proposing to tweak some of the wording. It proposes the following statement: Israel\u2019s aid blockade, which risks mass death from starvation in Gaza and millions of Palestinians facing catastrophic hunger, is a breach of international law. Cash \u2018saddened\u2019 about Gaza but Coalition won\u2019t support Greens motion FollowingMehreen Faruqi\u2019sspeech on the motion to urge the Albanese government to do more to pressure the Israeli government to \u201copen all border crossings and allow the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid\u201d, the opposition Senate leader,Michaelia Cash, is ready to speak. Cash says the opposition will not be supporting the motion but says: Nobody wants to see the suffering of people in Gaza, and we are saddened and shocked like everybody at the loss of life in Gaza \u2026 The remainder of the speech centres heavily on Palestinian militant group Hamas rather than the ongoing humanitarian crisis, which has left much of Gaza\u2019s population in starvation. She says: The Greens never seem to want to actually admit that the blame for this war lies squarely at the feet of the militant terrorist organisation Hamas. The Coalition, on the other hand, fundamentally believes that the moral responsibility for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is squarely on the terrorist group Hamas. Chair of parliament\u2019s pro-Israel caucus has concerns about Australia\u2019s \u2018willingness\u2019 to recognise a Palestinian state Andrew Wallacesays a pro-Israel caucus has concerns around the Albanese government\u2019s \u201cwillingness\u201d to recognise a Palestinian state. The Liberal MP and chair of the Australia Israel Allies Caucus told the ABC a short time ago that the Coalition favoured a two-state, negotiated process between Israel and Palestinians \u201cand we think that any attempt to try to bring unilaterally the recognition of a Palestinian state forward is really just rewarding Hamas for the attacks that it perpetrated on Israel on 7 October 2023\u201d. He said Australia did not have to follow in the UK\u2019s footsteps: The war could be over today if Hamas was to lay down its weapons, surrender, return the current 50 or so hostages that are still being held. Now to be talking about a Palestinian state at this point in time is still too early and it has to be done through a negotiated process. Just because the United Kingdom lands on a certain position doesn\u2019t mean that Australia has to either. There\u2019s no role for Hamas in a potential Palestinian state, Chalmers says Jim ChalmerssaysAnthony AlbaneseandPenny Wongare \u201cmaking sure that there\u2019s no role for Hamas\u201d in a potential Palestinian state. The treasurer told the ABC a short time ago that he did not pay heed toMichaelia Cash\u2019scomments that a Palestinian state should come only once peace had been reached in Gaza and was akin to a reward for Hamas. \u201cClearly an obstacle is \u2026 making sure that there\u2019s no role for Hamas,\u201d he said of plans around recognising a Palestinian state. He saidthe statement released by 15 countries, including Australia, was \u201creally, really important\u201d in that it denounced the terrorist act of 7 October, demanded a ceasefire, access for humanitarian workers and the release of the hostages, and called on countries to work towards recognition as part of progress towards a two-state solution. Chalmers said: From my point of view, personally and as a member of the government, there is real momentum here. That momentum, that progress, is welcome, but it\u2019s also conditional. Over in the Senate, the Greens are moving a motion for a matter of public urgency on Gaza. The Greens senatorNick McKimmoves the motion, which reads: That the risk of mass death from starvation in Gaza, with millions of Palestinians facing catastrophic hunger, is a result of Israel\u2019s aid blockade, and that it is critical the Australian government intensify its efforts \u2013 including diplomatic and economic measures \u2013 to pressure the Israeli government to open all border crossings and allow the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid. First up to speak isMehreen Faruqi. She says: It is brutal, it is inhumane and it is savage. We warned you all from the very beginning that this is where we will end up \u2026 but you flocked to defend Israel knowing they have long been killing, arresting, torturing and permanently injuring Palestinians for decades. Labor MPs, including members of this chamber, flocked to Israel for photo opportunities with genocidal Israeli soldiers \u2026 Here\u2019s a clip of the Atlassian co-founderScott Farquhardescribing how he deals with screens and online dangers in the privacy of his own home. The father of three told the National Press Club his approach is to opt for strict screen time limits and to make sure he knows what his children are viewing. New select committee to take on climate change misinformation The Greens have passed an inquiry this afternoon into third-party and groups who peddle mis- and disinformation about climate and energy policy in Australia. The minor party gained the support of Labor and some crossbenchers to form a new select committee into how misinformation and disinformation related to climate change and energy is \u201cfinanced, produced and disseminated\u201d. The Select Committee on Information Integrity on Climate Change and Energy will also examine the links between Australian organisations and international thinktanks and influence networks that are known to spread mis- and disinformation. The final vote was 39 ayes to 28 noes. One Nation and the United Australia party senatorRalph Babetjoined with the Coalition to vote against the inquiry.",

        "raw_text": "We\u2019ll leave our live coverage of the day\u2019s news there for this evening. Pressure over Palestine dominated our politics blog today \u2013 here were the major updates: Anthony Albanese said it was\u201cbeyond comprehension\u201d for Israel to claim there is no starvation crisis in Gaza. Labor ministerTim Ayressaid the PM\u2019s rebuke was just a case where \u201cfriends communicate\u201d.

And the re-electedTim Wilsonannounced he\u2019s in his \u201ctruth bomb phase,\u201d blaming Liberals\u2019 lack of vision for election rout in hissecond first speech to the House of Representatives. See you tomorrow. Tim Wilsonhas echoed the words of the Liberal party\u2019s founder, Robert Menzies, who once said the modern Liberal movement is \u201cnot the conservative party dying hard on the last barricade, but \u2026 of a lively mind and a forward-looking heart\u201d. Wilson has actually used this quote once before. Back in 2017, in the throes of the marriage equality plebiscite, Wilson delivered a speech criticising some MPs, including those within his party, for putting marriage equality to a popular vote \u2013 before ending the speech by proposing to his then-partner and now-husband. But returning to 2025, Wilson was back on the attack \u2013 this time criticising his party\u2019s conservative wing and the teal movement that ejected him from parliament back in 2022. Wilson said: I don\u2019t wear my faith on my sleeve, but the good book\u2019s insight that \u2018a house divided against itself cannot stand\u2019 is truer today than ever before ... I reject the politics that infected too many \u2013 from the extremities of the political spectrum and the corporate-funded independents who all share a different vision anchored in the same idea: that we might stand for some, but not all Australians ... Our party\u2019s founder called these attempts to pit Australians against each other \u2018false wars\u2019 ... we are all Australians. And nothing is more corrosive to the Australian promise than people no longer believing sacrifice and effort will get them ahead. Man faces court accused of selling police uniforms At least 28 pieces of police uniform have allegedly been sold illegally by a man who had access to the items through his employment,AAPreports.Benjamin Lee Onley, 50, appeared at Sydney\u2019s Sutherland local court on Tuesday after he was accused of stealing 71 pieces of unauthorised law enforcement uniform and attempting to sell them.Police allege Onley was employed by a company involved in the procurement and disposal of NSW police force uniform and insignia.Onley was arrested on Tuesday after detectives searched his home in Thirroul on the NSW south coast earlier in July and seized a mobile phone. Police allege the phone contained evidence that Onley had attempted to sell 71 pieces of NSWPF uniform and insignia, of which 28 were sold.Onley was also allegedly in possession of unauthorised firearms, including a pistol.Following his arrest, he was charged with four offences including stolen property charges and possession of prohibited firearms.Onley is in custody after not applying for bail at his first court appearance on Tuesday. The matter is expected to return to court on 12 August. The local share market has clawed back losses to close marginally higher ahead of a key inflation readout that could determine whether the Reserve Bank cuts interest rates,AAPreports. After a small decline early on Tuesday, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index moved into positive territory in the last 40 minutes of trading to close 6.9 points higher at 8,704.6. The energy sector was the biggest gainer on Tuesday, rising 0.7% as Santos rose 2.1% to $7.91 and Woodside gained 1.6% to $26.60. In the financial sector, CommBank dropped 0.4% to $174.29 as NAB advanced 1.2% to $38.20, while ANZ and Westpac stayed flat. Traders were cautious ahead of tomorrow\u2019s release of inflation data for the three months to June,IG market analyst Tony Sycamoresaid. He said the consumer price data would be key for the RBA: [It\u2019s] the final determining factor as to whether the RBA cuts rates in August \u2013 bringing potential relief to Australia\u2019s mortgage holders \u2013 or elects to keep rates on hold, opting for short-term pain for long-term gain in the fight against inflation, which many think has already been won. HSBC\u2019s chief Australia and New Zealand economist Paul Bloxhamsaid the bank expects the readout would show the RBA\u2019s preferred inflation metric to print at 0.6% quarter-on-quarter and 2.7% year-on-year, which HSBC sees as allowing the RBA to trim rates in August. But if trimmed mean inflation comes in at higher than that, an August rate cut would be less likely, Bloxham said. Goldstein MPTim Wilsonsays theLiberals\u2019 miserable election lossescame down to the opposition not offering a \u201cbold and courageous\u201d vision for Australians. The former MP, who was returned to the House of Representatives in the 2025 federal election after being ousted in 2022 by teal MP Zoe Daniel, delivered his second first speech in the lower house this evening, where he reflected on the opposition\u2019s recent losses. Underthe chamber\u2019s practices, members who have already delivered a first speech in the same chamber don\u2019t usually get a second chance. Wilson recognised the cheeky move, describing his earlier first speech as his \u201cfirst-first\u201d speech as opposed to his second-first speech. But moving on, Wilson has used this (second) first speech to announce he\u2019s in his \u201ctruth-bomb phase\u201d before offering some insights about why Australians punished the Liberals at the polls. Wilson said: It\u2019s simple: You can\u2019t multiply your vote by dividing Australians. It betrays Menzian liberalism, because liberalism has no geography ... Liberalism is the spark of aspiration that compels a young farm hand to milk cows before sun\u2019s rise so they can save to own their own dairy farm one day ... And at the last election, we let them down because we were not the bold and courageous Liberals that gave Australians confidence to dare for a better future. \u2018Good on them\u2019: Liberal MP applauds Nationals push to dump net zero Liberal frontbencher James McGrathhas compared concerns over acampaign to drop Australia\u2019s target of net zero emissionsby 2050 to a meltdown and a caffeine overdose. Asked about the push, led byNationals backbenchers Barnaby Joyce and Michael McCormack, McGrath told the ABC: The whole building is having a meltdown because some members of the National party have a different view on net zero and want to push forward and advocate their views.Guess what? Good on them. So what?Are there any other issues out there? I want to focus on Chris Bowen and focus that Labor promised to cut power bills by $275. McGrath said he believed Australia should cut emissions as long as economic crash could be avoided but said theCoalitionwas a \u201cboisterous party\u201d: I don\u2019t understand why this building is having [a meltdown]. It\u2019s almost like everyone has overdosed on caffeine or something like that. Data on Indigenous deaths in custody prompts call to cut NT police funding More than 600 Indigenous Australians havedied in policy custodysince 1991, new data shows, prompting calls for cuts to police funding in Northern Territory. Victorian senator Lidia Thorpeand First Nations advocacy organisations have called for the Albanese government to pause federal funding for NT policing and prisons until the Territory moves to reduce incarceration of First Peoples and children. Thorpe told the ABC the government had provided $205m in funding to the NT police, labelled as \u2018closing the gap\u2019 money.She said this should be redirected to community organisations: Imagine $205m going to communities to self-determine what is best for us or what is best for them. Our children don\u2019t belong in prisons \u2026 The federal government, through the Closing The Gap initiative, is funding the police instead. So there is a way that feds can step in, firstly to remove that money, take it back and give it back to those self-determined programs that actually work. The number of Indigenous people who have died in custody has reached 602 since 1992\u2019s royal commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, according to the Australian Institute of Criminology. That includes 60 in 2025 alone. Advocacy groups including North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency have warned the incarceration crisis is escalating, backing calls for suspending commonwealth funding until the police force changes direction.The number of NT residents imprisoned has hit a record highsince the Country Liberal government was elected with a tough on crime approach. Not possible to declare Palestinian state while Hamas dominates, Labor frontbencher says Labor frontbencher Rebecca Whitehas said the government has \u201cgrave concerns\u201d at the prospect Palestine could be recognised as a state, due to Hamas\u2019 strength in the region. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has said Australia has no plans to follow France and more than 140 other countries byrecognising the state of Palestine. That reluctance is in part due to fears over Hamas\u2019 ongoing power in the region, Rebecca White, Labor\u2019s assistant minister for health, has said. She told the ABC: I don\u2019t think any of us at the moment feel that it\u2019s possible, with Hamas being so dominant in the region, to just simply declare a Palestinian state without having grave concerns for what that looks like and the prime minister has been clear that we won\u2019t do this as a tokenistic gesture. It\u2019s about making sure that when we can join with other nations across the world to support a two-state solution. We would like to see that achieved and I understand that both sides across the chamber want the same thing. The UK government has facedrising internal and external pressureto recognise the state of Palestine. Australian Labor branches are also pushing for immediate recognition \u2013 you can read more here: New Bradfield MP \u2018ready to roll\u2019 if court challenge forces byelection Nicolette Boelehas committed to working constructively with the court as the Liberal party challengesher narrow election to a North Sydney seat. The independent MP for Bradfield won the seat after a recount of the federal election result, which delivered her the seat on a thin margin of 26 votes. She said she was confident in that process but wouldn\u2019t stand in the way of the Liberal challenge: It\u2019s a great credit to the strength of our democracy that we have that relief valve and I\u2019ll be doing everything in my power to be a constructive part of getting a resolution. \u2026 [The challenge] has sharpened my attention and made me work really, really hard. Boele said she would go back to her electorate campaigning on climate, cost-of-living and housing issues if the challenge produced a byelection. Asked whether she was ready for that outcome, Boele said: Ready to roll. The New SouthWales police have knocked back an application to facilitate a pro-Palestineprotest across the Sydney Harbour Bridgethis weekend due to \u201cpublic safety\u201d. Deputy commissionerPeter McKennasaid the police were yet to inform the Sydney-based Palestine Action Group of their decision, but were open to negotiate an alternative route for the protest. If the group stands by its plan to proceed with the protest across the bridge this weekend, he said the police would challenge it in the supreme court. McKenna said: I know people will say that we have closed [it before]. You need to understand, months and months of planning goes into that. Asked what the minimum amount of notice is that the police would need to facilitate such a protest, he said: It depended on many, many factors, [that\u2019s] probably too complex to articulate in a few words. But like I said, if I give the example of a Sydney marathon, there\u2019s about 10 months of planning. If the matter is heard in the supreme court, and it sides with police, then it means anyone who attends the protest will not be protected from being charged under the anti-protest laws. McKenna said the police will have resources on standby in case the protest does go ahead. Independent senator David Pocock has repeated calls for sanctions on Israel over its war in Gaza, criticising the Albanese government\u2019s approach of \u201csaying harsher and harsher things\u201d. The prime minister over the weekend heightened hiscriticism of the Israeli governmentbut the Canberra senator said he was not satisfied with Labor\u2019s approach. Pocock told the ABC: The time for just words is over. We\u2019ve even got President Trump now saying that clearly starvation is happening. It\u2019s time to start with more targeted sanctions, starting with Prime Minister Netanyahu, ratcheting them up \u2026 What\u2019s it going to take for this government? Just saying harsher and harsher things is not going to have an impact. Pocock, who has advocated targeted sanctions on Israel for over a year, said the government\u2019s approach had given rise to increasing community protests and advocacy. A lot of the unrest we\u2019re seeing, people wanting to protest, is looking at what we\u2019re seeing: this sort of live-streamed human-induced famine and then seeing a prime minister and a \u2018government that just says, \u2018Oh, well, we\u2019re saying harsher and harsher things\u2019. They want our government to act. One of those protests in support of Palestine, a march planned for this Sunday across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, is facing pressure from the government in New South Wales. We\u2019re expecting an update on how police will handle the march shortly.",

On 8 July, Lauren Gillin\u2019s agency told her she needed to be home during a two-and-a-half-hour window seven days from that date to allow access for a smoke alarm inspector or pay a $90 fee. \u201cPlease make yourself available, this inspection is compulsory, and access must be provided,\u201d Gillin\u2019s property manager at Rich & Oliva said in a letter seen by Guardian Australia. \u201cShould access not be made available, a fee of $90 will be incurred for re-inspection.\u201d In a statement, a NSW Fair Trading spokesperson said real estate agents must provide two days\u2019 notice for \u201cnon-urgent repairs or inspection of a smoke alarm\u201d. However, \u201cthere is no requirement for the tenant to be in the property for the inspection,\u201d the spokesperson confirmed. Further, \u201cthe Residential Tenancies Act 2010 (NSW) limits fees and charges a landlord or agent can ask a tenant to pay, with only certain payments such as rent, rental bond and other prescribed fees allowed to be charged\u201d. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Gillin, a media manager at a community legal centre who lives in Haberfield in Sydney\u2019s inner west, said she was disappointed by the letter. \u201cIt\u2019s an unreasonable request to be home for 2.5 hours on a weekday.\u201d Tenants of an apartment block in the city\u2019s eastern suburbs received a similar notice from a different real estate agency, which Guardian Australia has chosen not to identify because renters said they were worried about the potential consequences. That agency wrote to the tenants in June, in an email seen by Guardian Australia, telling them they needed to be home on a day late that month between 9.30am and 10.30am for a mandatory fire safety inspection. The email warned that any failure to give access to the home would result in a re-inspection fee of $330 and advised the tenants to organise someone on their behalf to allow access if they could not do so. The Tenants\u2019 Union of NSW chief executive officer, Leo Patterson Ross, said the $90 charge Gillin faced did not \u201cstrictly have any basis\u201d because the agent or landlord could still give access to the smoke alarm inspector by organising entry. \u201cAs long as the tenant hasn\u2019t actively prevented them from entering the property, then there\u2019s no basis for that charge,\u201d he said. Patterson Ross said the $330 fee faced by residents of the eastern suburbs apartment block was \u201cpretty much the exact same situation\u201d \u2013 there was no legal basis for the charge. \u201cThe agent, probably, in a building like that where there\u2019s a lot of people, they don\u2019t want to spend their whole day walking around all the apartments,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing stopping them from doing that.\u201d Patterson Ross said more than 2,100 people contacted the tenants\u2019 union in 2024 for advice about access issues. He said he regularly spoke to renters who had been threatened with fees for supposedly not allowing access to their homes, who assumed the charges were legitimate. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion \u201cNo one\u2019s told the agent they can\u2019t do it and it becomes normal and then they train other people and it becomes process without anyone really checking whether it\u2019s compliant with the law,\u201d Patterson Ross said. \u201cGenerally, a lot of the pressure of enforcing the legislation is falling on the tenant at the moment.\u201d Gillin said she tried to raise her concerns with one of the Rich & Olivia staff members, but did not feel the issue was resolved. The company did not respond to Guardian Australia\u2019s request for comment. On 8 July, Gillin lodged a complaint with the agency. In the email, seen by Guardian Australia, Gillin said her experience with the agency had otherwise \u201cbeen really positive\u201d which made the letter she got from them \u201call the more surprising\u201d. She followed up on 9 July, citing legal adviceshe had received from the tenants\u2019 union and the NSW rental commissioner, Trina Jones, that she did not need to be at home during a smoke alarm inspection. Jones told Guardian Australia that a fee for not being present during a smoke alarm inspection could not legally be passed on to tenants. She said the state\u2019s rental taskforce \u2013 which was created earlier this year \u2013 contacted Gillin\u2019s agent to advise them of their responsibilities under the law and make clear the charge was not permitted. \u201cIllegal fees and charges remain an issue in the sector,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSince January, the Rental Taskforce has overseen refunds of $165,303 to renters who were charged unlawful fees.\u201d On Wednesday, Gillin said the smoke alarm technician let her know they had got a key from the agency to let themselves into the property.

        "raw_text": "The finance department has found consultancy firmPwCAustralia is an ethically sound company and recommended the end of a long-term ban on it working with the government, despite an ongoing police investigation into the company. But the firm, which sold its entire government consulting business for just $1 at the height of a scandal over the misuse of confidential Treasury information, will not be able to tender for government work until at least 2028 due to a non-compete clause with its spin-off, Scyne Advisory. In April 2024, the finance department and PwC Australia agreed on the firm\u2019s exclusion from new government work while itgrappled with the fallout from the damaging tax leaks scandal. The exclusion allowed PwC Australia to conduct an overhaul of its culture and processes, and led to the conclusion of two parliamentary inquiries into the matter. The ban also allowed the finance department to conduct its own examination of PwC Australia\u2019s ethical soundness and whether it had done enough to regain its trust. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Guardian Australia has seen a decision from the finance department\u2019s acting assistant secretary, Richard Windeyer, confirming the department had decided the ban on PwC Australia should be lifted. \u201cFinance\u2019s review concludes that PwC has made substantial progress in implementing governance, accountability and cultural reforms, along with improved risk and conflict management systems,\u201d Windeyer said on Thursday. \u201cAdvice received from the Australian Federal Police regarding the status of their investigations into PwC is that investigations are related to former, and not current, employees/partners of PwC, and the timing of the outcome is unknown. \u201cBased on this, Finance has determined the ongoing investigations into PwC\u2019s past actions does not prevent concluding this review and the fitness of PwC Australia to work with the Commonwealth in the future.\u201d Windeyer\u2019s letter said the department\u2019s 48 page report into PwC Australia and its findings would be published on 25 July. But the report, also seen by Guardian Australia, has not yet been made public. A spokesperson for the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, said the minister was seeking feedback from senators involved in parliamentary inquiries into PwC Australia before the outcome of the department\u2019s review was finalised. \u201cThis period of consultation is ongoing and the report will be finalised after any feedback or other relevant information has been received and considered,\u201d the spokesperson said. The Australian federal police has confirmed it is still investigating how confidential Treasury information about draft taxation was shared by a former PwC Australia partner to win private sector work overseas.

The police investigation, dubbed Operation Alesia, is examining whether formerPwCAustralia staff committed a crime by disclosing official secrets. The finance department\u2019s decision is likely to be criticised by two senators who led parliamentary inquiries into the consultancy firm\u2019s alleged conduct \u2013 Greens senator Barbara Pocock and Labor senator Deborah O\u2019Neill \u2013 who have said previously they do not believe the ban should be lifted until the police investigation is concluded. Finance\u2019s decision is expected to be seen as an endorsement of the measures PwC Australia has put in place since the scandal decimated its reputation and income from government contracts. The company is not expected to resume tendering for government work, having sold its advisory business. PwC Australia has argued the firm\u2019s culture, internal processes and governance have been significantly overhauled since the damaging scandal. Before Guardian Australia revealed the decision, O\u2019Neill said she strongly stood by her recommendation that \u201cPwC Australia cannot be allowed to tender again for government services until \u2013 at the very least \u2013 all investigations into its conduct are complete\u201d.

We should move to recognise Palestine now, standing alongside France, because there will be a number of countries that will do so and given our party has said we want to do this, it seems right that the time is now for us to step forward and say we will recognise the state of Palestine now. We will wrap up the live blog here for the evening. Here\u2019s what made the news today: The prime minister,Anthony Albanese,released a strong statementon the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, calling on Israel to end its blockade of aid and immediately comply with its obligations under international law. The opposition said the statement was \u2018one-sided\u2019 and ignored Hamas\u2019s role in blocking aid. The UK and Australian foreign ministerssaid the deteriorating situation in Gaza was \u2018indefensible\u2019. France\u2019s plan to recognise Palestinian statehood led to calls from formerforeign ministerBob Carrand Labor backbencherEd Husicfor Australia to follow suit. The US president,Donald Trump, has claimed the US will\u201csell so much\u201d beefto Australia following the lifting of biosecurity restrictions on the import of US and Canadian beef yesterday.

AI has \u2018huge potential\u2019 to boost productivity, commission chair says The chair of the Productivity Commission,Danielle Wood, says AI has \u201chuge potential\u201d to improve productivity in Australia. Ahead of the economic reform roundtable next month, Wood told ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing there was \u201chuge upside potential\u201d for AI to improve productivity, and the government settings would need to support AI adoption. However, she said it would also need to manage risk in a way that doesn\u2019t stifle innovation. She said a question to be grappled with is training and skilling people in small and medium businesses on AI to get the most out of it. She said businesses shifting to AI use should consult unions and workers about the technology and how it would work, but expressed concern if unions sought to block its use. It is a different argument if it\u2019s a question of should a union should be able to knock out a business from adopting new technology. That is a bigger leap, and that would be something that we would be more concerned with. Liberal shadow minister claims PM\u2019s Gaza statement \u2018one-sided\u2019 The federal shadow minister for education,Jonno Duniam,criticised the prime minister\u2019s statement about Gaza as being \u201cone-sided\u201d and claimed Hamas was also playing a role in blocking aid in the region. He told ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing he had been in contact with representatives of the Israeli government in Australia to understand the situation, who said Hamas was preventing the delivery of aid in northern Gaza. What I take issue with is a claim that it is Israel holding up aid and that is the pure cause and beginning and end of this issue. He said \u201cany party to the conflict hampering the flow of aid\u201d needs to stop, but that the claim that it was just Israel stopping the aid was not \u201cbased in fact\u201d. That is what I take issue with. I don\u2019t dispute children are starving. I have seen images myself and it breaks my heart as a father, and I would never want to see that continue. All parties need to do what they can to resolve this and do everything we as western countries expect to be the case, to protect and preserve human life especially [the] vulnerable. Carr says most Australians \u2018outraged\u2019 at \u2018mass starvation\u2019 in Gaza The former foreign ministerBob Carrsaid there was \u201cmomentum in the western world\u201d to recognise Palestinian statehood. He said most Australians and 99% of the Labor party base supported it. The Australian people are now outraged with what is happening. There has not been a poll on this since the savagery of the policy based on mass starvation has been given such spirited force from Israel. The former foreign ministerBob Carrsays Australia should recognise Palestinian statehood quickly to avoid risking looking like Australia is waiting for the UK to move, and \u201cwe are not confident enough\u201d to move with France. He told ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing that it would send a message to south-east Asian countries. Australia should move quickly and that would send a message to our friends in South-East Asia and Malaysia and Indonesia here that we are [alert] to the terrible suffering of the civilian population. It would be appropriate for us to move and to move without giving the impression we are waiting for Britain to do it. He said it would also send a powerful message to Israel about its \u201cappalling behaviour\u201d and a message of hope to Palestinians. Right now, we\u2019re looking at [a] bigger fact and that is that little babies are having their bodies collapsed in on them. They\u2019re talking about boys who had been sent to pick up food to bring back to their families who have been shot, and it seems to be an orderly process of shooting kids being sent out to get food. I don\u2019t know how people can pretend to be part of our species [that] can calculate such cruelty. NSW Liberal leader responds after Gareth Ward found guilty of sexual abuse The NSW opposition leader,Mark Speakman, has released a statement after MPGareth Wardwas found guilty of sexually abusing two young men. Speakman said: I respect the verdict and the robust process which delivered it. What any victim of sexual abuse endures is appalling and their strength in coming forward can\u2019t be overstated. There is no excuse for the criminal behaviour which the jury has found occurred beyond reasonable doubt \u2013 a complete abuse of power which has no place anywhere, let alone by those entrusted by the public to represent them. Ward, who has held the seat for Kiama since 2011, left the Liberal party in 2021 after it was revealed the police were investigating him over the allegation. He ran again as an independent in the 2023 state election. More on the verdict here: Foreign ministers questioned on Palestinian statehood and support The UK foreign secretary,David Lammyhas been asked what practical outcomes of meetings with Germany and France about Gaza could result in, such as airdrops or a pier. Lammy says airdrops are in discussion with partners in Jordan, and the UK has increased funding to support medical needs in Gaza, but there needs to be a sustained ceasefire to allow trucks into Gaza. He didn\u2019t directly comment again on whether the UK would support Palestinian statehood alongside France. The Australian foreign minister,Penny Wong, said Australia had provided $110m in humanitarian aid to the region so far, and was working with Jordan and others to deliver aid that \u201cwe are able to\u201d. So we do all of those things, recognising that ultimately what is required is an immediate ceasefire, release of hostages and aid to flow unimpeded in relation to two states \u2026 I responded to your colleague previously. We are committed to making a two-state solution a reality, and committed to working with other countries to making that happen. I\u2019ve outlined the challenges associated with that. But, ultimately, we end up where David has outlined where is the prospect of peace for both peoples, for Israelis and Palestinians, unless the international community and the parties can find a way to two states.",

        "raw_text": "A welfare reform package that includes raising jobseeker to 90% of the age pension would lift 590,000 Australians out of poverty, with the $11bn price tag paid for by curbing super tax concessions in a way that still leaves the vast majority of savers better off. A new Australian National University paper for the St Vincent de Paul Society, titled A Fairer Tax andWelfareSystem for Australia, examines a range of options that \u201care targeted to benefit persons who have the greatest financial need and would be paid for by those most able to accommodate a modest additional contribution\u201d. In addition to the rise in the main unemployment benefit, the \u201cmajor\u201d reform package also includes increases to commonwealth rent assistance and payments to families and single parents. The analysis lands less than a month out fromJim Chalmers\u2019 economic reform roundtable, which will bring together representatives from government, business and unions in an attempt to achieve a consensus around concrete measures to lift the country\u2019sabysmal productivity performance. But with an estimated one in 10 Australians, or nearly 3 million people, living in households experiencing poverty, the charitable organisation\u2019s report highlights the urgent need tomake the country more equitableas well as more efficient. Mark Gaetani, Vinnies\u2019 national president, said he was hopeful the reforms put forward in the report would be seriously considered at Labor\u2019s summit. \u201cYes, the government does need to address productivity. But there are two sides to the coin, and the options we put forward will make a really significant difference to those who are doing it really tough and who we see coming through our doors every day,\u201d Gaetani said. \u201cWhat we are putting forward is budget neutral. We are simply asking those well off in the community to forgo in the vicinity of $3,000-3,500 a year to offset the cost of assisting those 3 million Australians who live under the poverty line.\u201d Sign up: AU Breaking News email Ben Phillips, an associate professor at ANU who co-wrote the report with Richard Webster, said increasing the jobseeker benefit for singles and couples was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d. \u201cPeople don\u2019t talk about the age pension as a king\u2019s ransom, and lifting jobseeker to 90% of that just takes it back to 1990s levels,\u201d Phillips said, noting that it was in line with the recommendation by the government\u2019s economic inclusion advisory committee. The ANU sets the poverty line at $486 a week, or half the median household disposable income of after housing costs. In comparison, the full jobseeker rate for an individual is $390 a week, or about 75% of the $525 rate for a single age pensioner. Lifting it to 90% would involve a weekly rise of about $80. More than half of people on jobseeker or youth allowance are in households experiencing poverty, and the report noted that the balance between avoiding disincentives to work and providing an adequate safety net had become skewed too far in one direction. \u201cThe pendulum needs to swing back towards adequacy,\u201d it said. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion The ANU poverty rates are adjusted to exclude those with low income but with high wealth, such as some retirees. Single parents are much more likely to experience severe financial disadvantage, with poverty rates among this group reaching an estimated one in three. The proposed reform would lift youth allowance and the partnered parenting payment by the same proportional amount as jobseeker, and increase the single parenting payment to equal the age pension. The report said the jobseeker rate and related payments should also be increased each year in line with wages, rather than inflation. The family tax benefit part A should be raised to the same as for older eligible children, and the link between wage growth and family payments should also be re-established, it said. With one in five renters estimated to be in poverty, or twice the national average, suggested changes to the welfare system included a 15% increase in commonwealth rent assistance, as well as an additional $100 supplementary payment to those receiving the disability support pension in recognition that an estimated 37% of people on working age pensions are below the poverty line. The measures in the reform proposal would be paid for by replacing the flat 15% tax on super contributions and earnings with a rate set at the saver\u2019s marginal tax rate minus 20 percentage points. The reform to superannuation concessions that Phillips modelled would leave 90% of savers no worse off, and in some cases better off, he said. \u201cThe people who it [the super tax change] would impact negatively are those whose income is above the $190,000 level, where the marginal rate is 45 cents in the dollar.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "TheTrump administrationhas claimed credit for Labor\u2019s decision to lift restrictions on imports of US beef into Australia, saying non-scientific trade barriers had left American farmers \u201con the sidelines\u201d for two decades. The government confirmed on Thursday morning that the agriculture department would allow imports into Australia of meat processed in the US but grown in Mexico and Canada. The notable shift in stance came as Labor pushes the White House for relief from new tariffs on pharmaceuticals andsteel and aluminium. The agriculture minister, Julie Collins, claimed the decision was unrelated to President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating trade war, even as her US counterpart, Brooke L Rollins, congratulated Trump for securing the major breakthrough. \u201cAmerican farmers and ranchers produce the safest, healthiest beef in the world,\u201d Rollins said. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd that non-scientific trade barriers prevented our beef from being sold to consumers in Australia for the last 20 years. Gone are the days of putting American farmers on the sidelines. \u201cThis is yet another example of the kind of market access the president negotiates to bring America into a new golden age of prosperity, with American agriculture leading the way.\u201d A ban on beef from cows raised and slaughtered in the US was lifted in 2019 but restrictions remained on beef from cattle raised from Canada and Mexico. The concession was expected to help pave the way for the prime minister,Anthony Albanese, to argue the case to Trump that Australia should be given exemptions from the US\u2019s 50% tariff on steel and aluminium, and a looming 200% tariff planned for pharmaceuticals. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The US president specifically cited Australia\u2019s restrictions on beef imports when he announced his\u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff regime. Australia faces a 10% baseline tariff on all products exported to the US. During the federal election campaign, Albanese said Australia would not change or compromise any biosecurity rules, \u201cfull stop, exclamation mark\u201d. Despite the comments, a concession on beef had been expected from Australia. Collins said the government wanted fair and open trade, which significantly benefited the cattle industry. \u201cThe US beef imports review has undergone a rigorous science and risk-based assessment over the past decade.\u201d Asked if the move would help with trade negotiations with the Trump White House, Collins said: \u201cThat will be determined but this decision is based on science, and is the culmination of a five-year period.\u201d Detail on the changes published by the department showed the tracing systems rely on tamper-proof ear tags approved by US officials, with tag numbers recorded in appropriate export documentation so animals can be traced back to their farm of origin. Each animal will also have branding on their skin. American beef herds are at a multi-decade low, and farmers are slaughtering fewer animals than they were a year ago. Beef exports to the US from Australia were up 24% year-on-year in June,Meat and Livestock Australia said. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, said he was \u201csuspicious\u201d about the speed of the decision, months after Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cI want to see the science and it should be predicated on science,\u201d he told ABC radio. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion \u201cI\u2019m suspicious by the speed in which this has been done. It looks as though it\u2019s been traded away to appease Donald Trump, and that\u2019s what we don\u2019t want.\u201d But the trade minister, Don Farrell, said there was \u201cnothing suspicious\u201d about the timing. \u201cIf we want to export our beef overseas, then we have to accept that other countries will want to import their beef into Australia. The job of the federal government is to make absolutely certain that there is no biosecurity risk as a result of that. We\u2019ve done that.\u201d The new arrangements were due to come into place on 28 July, with Australian importers able to apply for permits to handle fresh beef products from the US, the largest buyer of Australian beef, ahead of China, in a $14bn market. Will Evans, the chief executive of Cattle Australia, told ABC RN on Thursday morning that there would be \u201ca lot of people today who feel blind-sided by this\u201d, but it was important to recognise that the decision was backed by science and the trade terms were still in Australia\u2019s favour. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of people today who are going to feel really frustrated and threatened by this. What we need to do is talk to them about these technical steps that have been taken, these are the assessments that\u2019s been taken, and this is why the decision\u2019s been made,\u201d Evans said. Australia was a \u201cglobal advocate for rules of science-based trading\u201d, but it was unfortunate that in this circumstance the government has had to \u201copen a door that we probably, as a producer, you probably wouldn\u2019t want to open\u201d, Evans said. \u201cBut we have to recognise that the science has been used to make this decision\u201d. \u201cThis is a big and very valuable market to Australian cattle producers,\u201d Evans said. \u201cAustralia exports more than $4bn of beef a year into the US. It\u2019s one of our largest and most important partners. In the last six months, we\u2019ve been breaking records in terms of the amount of volume that we\u2019re putting into the market, given that the US herd is currently at record lows.\u201d The National Farmers Federation president, David Jochinke, said the US request for more market access should be dealt with separately from tariff negotiations. \u201cThe Australian government has assured industry that they have undertaken the standard, science-based review process to protect Australia\u2019s biosecurity. \u201cFree and fair trade relies on the reciprocal recognition of trusted standards and processes between trading partners,\u201d he said.",

        "raw_text": "With mass deportations of migrants across America \u2013 not to mention reports of people being put in shackles or made to kneel and eat \u201clike dogs\u201d \u2013 Nora Guthrie is disappointed there hasn\u2019t been more noise from musicians about the issue. \u201cI\u2019ve been out protesting every weekend,\u201d says the 75-year-old daughter of singer-songwriterWoody Guthrie, and founder of the Woody Guthrie Archive. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve found myself asking, \u2018Where are the songs for us to sing about this?\u2019\u201d In need of a track that meets the moment, she turned to Deportee, a song her father wrote in 1948 in response to a plane crash in California that killed four Americans and 28 Mexican migrant workers, who were being deported. \u201cA few days later, only the Americans were named and the rest were called \u2018deportees\u2019,\u201d explains Nora\u2019s daughter Anna Canoni, who recently succeeded her mother as president of Woody Guthrie Publications, over a joint video call from New York. \u201cWoody read about it in the New York Times and the same day penned the lyric.\u201d Originally a poem, the song (often subtitled Plane Wreck at Los Gatos) was first popularised by folk singers Martin Hoffman and Pete Seeger and has since been covered by the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Joni Mitchell. Now, though, leaps in AI audio restoration technology mean we can finally hear Guthrie\u2019s own long-lost, home-recorded version, and it\u2019s striking how powerfully it speaks to the way migrant workers are demonised today. They \u201cfall like dry leaves to rot on my topsoil\u201d, he sings, \u201cand be called by no name except \u2018deportees\u2019\u201d. Singer Billy Bragg argues that \u201cWhen the ICE [US Immigration and Customs Enforcement] are rounding people up in fields, the song could hardly be more relevant.\u201d Initially a single, Deportee also appears on Woody at Home, Vol 1 and 2, a new 22-track treasure trove of Guthrie\u2019s final recordings (including 13 previously unheard songs), made at home in 1951 and 1952, just months before he was first hospitalised with the neurodegenerative Huntington\u2019s disease that led to his death aged 55 in 1967. \u201cHe\u2019d been blacklisted [during the McCarthy era, for activism], so he couldn\u2019t perform as much and couldn\u2019t get on the radio,\u201d says Nora. \u201cHuntington\u2019s was seeping into his body and his mind. The tapes are a last push to get the songs out, because he senses something is wrong.\u201d Guthrie\u2019s advocacy for migrant workers and social justice was informed by lived experience. Born into a middle-class family in Okemah, Oklahoma, he was just 14 when the family lost their home and he subsequently lived through the dust bowl, the Great Depression, the second world war and the rise of fascism. \u201cHe had to migrate from Oklahoma to California,\u201d says Bragg. \u201cHe knew what it was like to lose your home, to be dispossessed, to go on the road. The Okies were really no different to those Mexican workers and were just as reviled.\u201d Performing with the slogan \u201cThis machine kills fascists\u201d written on his guitar, Guthrie packed his seminal 1940 debut Dust Bowl Ballads with what Anna calls \u201chard-hitting songs for hard-hit people\u201d. He penned his most famous anthem, This Land Is Your Land \u2013 a new version of which opens Woody At Home with extra verses \u2013 after a road trip, as the lyric says, \u201cfrom California to the New York island\u201d. \u201cWoody wrote it because he was really pissed off with hearing Irving Berlin\u2019s God Bless America on every jukebox,\u201d says Bragg. \u201cIt annoyed the shit out of him. I\u2019ve actually seen the original manuscript for the song and crossed out at the top is Woody\u2019s original title, God Blessed America for You and Me, which I think gives him claim to be an alternative songwriter, the archetypal punk rocker.\u201d Between the early 1930s and the 1950s, Guthrie penned an astonishing 3,000 songs, recording more than 700 of them. The Woody at Home recordings were made at his family\u2019s rented apartment in Beach Haven, Brooklyn, on a primitive machine given to him by his publisher with a view to selling the songs to other artists. With his wife out working, the increasingly poorly singer somehow managed to record 32 reels of tape while minding three kids. Sounds of knocks on doors, and even Nora as a toddler, appear on the tapes along with conversational messages. \u201cHe\u2019d write on the couch with the kids jumping on his head,\u201d Anna says. \u201cHe\u2019d write on gift wrappers or paper towels. We\u2019ve found some of Woody\u2019s most beautiful quotes in correspondence, like in a 1948 letter to [folk music champion] Alan Lomax, \u2018A folk song is what\u2019s wrong and how to fix it.\u2019 Sometimes he only had time for a title. Everything was coming out so quickly he had to get it down.\u201d Woody at Home contains previously unheard songs about racism (Buoy Bells From Trenton), fascism (I\u2019m a Child Ta Fight) and corruption (Innocent Man) but also showcases the breadth of Guthrie\u2019s canon. There are songs about love, Jesus Christ, atoms \u2026 even Albert Einstein, whom he once met and took a train with. It tickles Nora that her father wrote \u201cno less than five songs about washing dishes\u201d. Guthrie wrote Old Man Trump, also known as Beach Haven Race Hate, about their landlord, Fred Trump \u2013 father of Donald \u2013 and his segregative housing policies. Woody at Home premieres another song about him, Backdoor Bum and the Big Landlord. \u201cIt\u2019s really the story of how the guy who has everything gives nothing and the guy who has nothing gives everything,\u201d says Nora. \u201cMy favourite bit is when the landlord gets to heaven laden with gold. They send him to hell and he goes, \u2018Let me see your manager. I\u2019m gonna buy this place and kick you out.\u2019 The arrogance and entitlement are astonishing, but it clearly defines someone we all know. We lived in Trump buildings. We know who they are.\u201d The family moved to Queens where, when Nora was 11, she answered the door to an inquisitive 19-year-old singer-songwriter called Robert Zimmerman. The future Bob Dylan had read Guthrie\u2019s autobiography, Bound for Glory. \u201cI was a little upset because I was watching American Bandstand and had to answer the door,\u201d she chuckles. \u201cThere was this guy standing there who looked dusty and weird. I slammed the door and ran back to American Bandstand. But he kept on knocking.\u201d The 2024 Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown dramatises the iconic 1961 meetings between the teenage future legend and his hospitalised, dying idol. Nora loves the film, but points out: \u201cMy father wasn\u2019t in a room on his own like in the movie. Woody was on a ward with 40 patients, in a psychiatric hospital because there were no wards for people with Huntington\u2019s at the time. There was a sunroom to the side where Bob would meet him, take him pens and cigarettes. My memory is that Bob would not only sing his songs for Woody\u201d \u2013 Dylan subsequently recorded a heartfelt tribute, Song to Woody \u2013 \u201cbut that he\u2019d also sing my father\u2019s own songs to him. I can\u2019t emphasise enough how kind Bob was, but he understood that Woody needed to hear what he\u2019d achieved.\u201d By then, Guthrie was very ill. \u201cBecause of Huntington\u2019s I didn\u2019t have a dad in the traditional sense people talk about,\u201d Nora says with a sigh. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t really talk or have long conversations like we\u2019re having now. We couldn\u2019t have physical contact because with Huntington\u2019s your body\u2019s always moving. You\u2019d have to hold his arms back so you could hug him. If we ever went out to a restaurant people would look at us like he was drunk and that hurt.\u201d Nora became Woody\u2019s carer and, in her tireless curation of his legacy, has been caring for her father ever since. \u201cThat happened accidentally,\u201d she says, explaining how she\u2019d spent 10 years as a professional dancer when \u2013 in 1991 \u2013 Guthrie\u2019s retiring manager called her in to sort through boxes of his stuff. \u201cOne of the first things I pulled out was a letter from John Lennon,\u201d she says, fetching the framed letter, sent to the family in 1975, for me to see. It reads: \u201cWoody lives and I\u2019m glad.\u201d The next find was the original lyrics for This Land Is Your Land. \u201cIt was a treasure trove.\u201d From which there is more to come. His descendants hope to spark today\u2019s young songwriters \u2013 and protesters \u2013 in the way Guthrie did for Dylan, Springsteen and countless others. \u201cI see us as the coal holders,\u201d says Anna. \u201cWe keep Woody\u2019s ember burning so that whenever someone wants to ignite the fire in them, Woody is hot and ready.\u201d Deportee (Woody\u2019s Home Tape) is available now on streaming services. Woody At Home, Vol 1 and 2 is released on Shamus Records on 14 August",

        "raw_text": "For decades, Radiohead\u2019sThom Yorkeand the artist Stanley Donwood have been locked in an intense creative partnership. They scribble over each other\u2019s drawings, scrawl in each other\u2019s notebooks, push each other, inspire each other. Their work has been on every Radiohead album cover since 1995\u2019s The Bends, every Yorke solo record, every poster and every T-shirt. Nothing is farmed out to designers or agencies \u2013 Radiohead\u2019s visual identity has been fully overseen by Donwood and Yorke. And now, in a homecoming of sorts for local hero Yorke, their artistic output is being celebrated at Oxford\u2019sAshmolean Museum. There\u2019s no doubt that Donwood and Yorke, who met while studying at the University of Exeter, have created some of the most recognisable, ubiquitous and maybe even iconic album covers of their generation. But do they make sense in a huge, historic gallery such as the Ashmolean? Does any of it make for good art? Does it stand up to scrutiny when removed from the context of the records and merchandise it was designed for? It\u2019s a nice dream, but nope. The exhibition starts with LPs, CDs, posters and T-shirts arranged as though you are in a very hip but dour record shop. The gasping, deathly resuscitation dummy of The Bends; the ghostly schematics and angry doodles of OK Computer; the weeping little fella of Amnesiac; the mountains of Kid A; the multicoloured poetry of Hail to the Thief; the woodcuts of Yorke\u2019s The Eraser. This is how the work was meant to be seen, this is the context it works best in: arranged as if in racks, as if you could pull a record off the wall and play it. Donwood clearly has an issue with art galleries. \u201cThey\u2019re just intimidating \u2013 it\u2019s not very democratic,\u201d says a quote of his on the wall. \u201cWhereas you go into a record shop and it\u2019s full of all kinds of oiks.\u201d I\u2019m not sure I buy into this. Record shops can have exactly the same atmosphere of sneering exclusivity as galleries. There\u2019s a touchiness here that makes the show feel a little bitter. Guys, you\u2019re in the Ashmolean. You\u2019re not kicking against the establishment, you\u2019re in it. The exhibition goes album by album, with sketchbooks and paintings displayed to lay bare their creative process. Everything is jointly attributed, positioning Yorke and Donwood as equals. OK Computer sets an unfairly high bar early on in the show. The 1997 album captured the era\u2019s zeitgeist with its anxious teardown of corporate facelessness, technological paranoia and capitalist excess. It still resonates, as does its sense of isolation and loneliness in a world where you\u2019re constantly surrounded by people. The artwork looked like nothing else of its era: featuring a motorway overlaid with airplane safety manuals and the ghosts of people rushing by, the cover image looks how the music sounds \u2013 cold, frustrated, isolated, desperate. A brilliant meeting of music and album artwork. But it works infinitely better as a CD insert. You gain almost nothing by seeing these digital images enlarged, framed and plonked on a gallery wall. Radiohead would struggle to capture the moment again in quite the way they did with OK Computer. The same goes for the art. Donwood and Yorke made vast, bleak acrylic paintings for the covers of Kid A and Amnesiac. Eight canvases are displayed here and they are an unbelievable mess: badly composed, poorly executed, smudgy, splodgy, confused landscapes that even the RA Summer Exhibition would reject. The paintings of spiders and trees for 2011\u2019s King of Limbs are even worse; sub-A Level attempts at Max Ernst that almost make me embarrassed for them. The woodcuts for Yorke\u2019s solo albums are less visually offensive, and the ultra-colourful paintings of rivers and forests for the most recent albums by his other band the Smile work better as artworks, but are still quite a distance from anything you\u2019d call brilliant. Plenty of the work here, especially from the 90s and early 2000s, has entered the wider public consciousness in a way that proves album artwork has cultural heft. It matters. It has an impact. But that doesn\u2019t mean any of it is especially good, or even interesting, as art. If you\u2019re a Radiohead fan, there is tons of insight and detail here to keep you happy, but from an art perspective it is a succession of bad paintings. Donwood and Yorke probably shouldn\u2019t have put themselves in this position, but they did it to themselves, and that\u2019s what really hurts. This Is What You Get: Stanley Donwood, Radiohead, Thom Yorke is at theAshmolean Museum, Oxford, from 6 August to 11 January",

        "raw_text": "It was a late spring night in 1971 and David Sancious had walked from his home on E Street in Belmar, New Jersey to the Upstage club in Asbury Park. He was 17 and he had been playing piano and guitar with local bands for four years. \u201cI had walked to the Upstage because I wanted to play,\u201d he says, \u201cand as I\u2019m coming in I see Garry Tallent, a bass player who I already knew from other gigs.\u201d Tallent was with a fellow New Jersey musician, a 21-year-old guitarist calledBruce Springsteen, \u201cthe local guitar hero\u201d, says Sancious, \u201cvery famous locally.\u201d Springsteen told Sancious he was having a jam session and invited him to play. \u201cI said: \u2018Absolutely.\u2019\u201d The band played until 5am. As they were walking out of the club, Springsteen told Sancious he was breaking up his current band Steel Mill to form a new one: would he be interested in joining? Sancious said yes. He went on to record with Springsteen on his first three albums, but left the group before Born to Run transformed Springsteen and his bandmates into superstars. As that album approaches its 50th anniversary next month, I have wondered whether Sancious regrets walking away. He was five years old when his family moved into 1105 E Street in Belmar. The previous owners had left their piano in the house. \u201cThe day we moved in, my mum sat down and started playing Chopin and Beethoven,\u201d he says. \u201cIt blew my mind.\u201d Sancious started playing piano and later guitar and was in local bands in his early teens, giving illegal underage performances at local bars. \u201cThe police used to raid these places and card everyone,\u201d he says. \u201cOne night I\u2019m on stage with Bruce and the cops are hanging out at the front door.\u201d The band hatched a plan to get Sancious off stage, sandwiched between Springsteen, saxophonist Clarence Clemons and two others. \u201cI was in the middle moving slowly, trying not to draw any attention.\u201d Sancious and his bandmates sometimes rehearsed in his mother\u2019s garage, but mostly in a surfboard factory owned by an early manager of Springsteen\u2019s. \u201cYou don\u2019t know enough to be self-conscious because you haven\u2019t had that much experience yet,\u201d he says about those early days. Sancious contributed keyboards, piano and delicate jazz textures that enriched the early E Street sound on songs such as New York City Serenade and Incident on 57th Street. \u201cThe thing about Bruce is that musically he was always open to a good idea. If I came up with a certain chord or inversion, he was very open to that.\u201d Around 1974, Sancious and Springsteen were back in Belmar, by Sancious\u2019s childhood home. \u201cWe were coming home from somewhere,\u201d he says, \u201cturning on to E Street from 12th Avenue. There were these white obelisks with the street names painted on them. Bruce saw it and just said, \u2018E Street \u2026 E Street Band.\u2019\u201d How did it feel to have his address inspire this iconic band name? \u201cPretty cool \u2013 quite an honour.\u201d Sancious worked on Springsteen\u2019s debut Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ and its followup The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, and also toured with the band. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have private planes back then,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had a station wagon, three of the guys in the front and three in the back. You\u2019re doing everything with these people. Eating, laughing, crying with them if something really bad happens. It\u2019s a great life.\u201d He was the first Black member of what became the E Street Band \u2013 Clemons joined shortly after. \u201cYou are constantly, completely, 100% aware of being Black \u2013 full stop \u2013 in any situation,\u201d he says. He recalls one incident. \u201cI was at the beach and there were two guys making threatening gestures and saying inappropriate racial stuff. Clarence comes along and sees what\u2019s going on. He sat down right next to me and then Bruce comes walking by. Bruce found a piece of driftwood and he kept hitting it in his hand like he was saying: \u2018I\u2019m not going to let you hurt our friend.\u2019\u201d Sancious continued playing with Springsteen but during breaks from touring he was working on his own music. When CBS heard his demo they offered him a three-year contract that would launch his solo career. It was an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse, and shortly after playing on a song for Springsteen\u2019s third album \u2013 a little number called Born to Run \u2013 Sancious left the E Street Band. How did it feel, I ask, to see Born to Run become a massive hit album, and Springsteen on the covers of Time and Newsweek simultaneously? \u201cI felt very happy for him, honestly,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew it was going to happen for him.\u201d How did he know? \u201cWe did shows in Texas in 1974 and the crowd went nuts. We finished the show and the audience wouldn\u2019t leave. Bruce used to end the set with a song called For You that he would play by himself on piano and we would go off stage and watch. I remember standing there looking at him and thinking as soon as everybody finds out about this guy he\u2019s going to blow up. It\u2019s going to go crazy.\u201d In 1975 came the release not only of Born to Run but also Sancious\u2019s first solo album Forest of Feelings \u2013 a fusion of jazz, rock, funk and classical that suggested he had travelled far from E Street. Of the numerous albums that followed, both solo and with his band Tone, the most successful \u201cgot to No 78 in the Top 100 for one week. But my sense of self as an artist isn\u2019t diminished because I didn\u2019t sell a million records. That\u2019s a narrow definition of success and I don\u2019t resonate with that.\u201d In the early 80s, Sancious paused making his own music. \u201cThe phone kept ringing with artists asking me to go on tour,\u201d he says. \u201cI toured with Peter Gabriel and then Sting and later Eric Clapton and Santana. They have more in common than you might think: none of them had a plan B, they all did it out of a love for music.\u201d Sancious got to play the lead guitar riff to Clapton\u2019s Layla as well as the song\u2019s final piano coda when he toured with him \u2013 \u201csuch a thrill because I love that song and I love his playing\u201d. Sancious didn\u2019t return to the studio until 2000; he continues to record and tour today. He always remained in contact with Springsteen \u2013 he joined him on stage during the Human Rights Now! tour in 1988, and played on 1992\u2019s Human Touch album and 2019\u2019s Western Stars. He was part of the live band that backed Springsteen when he performed on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in November 2022. \u201cWe love each other,\u201d he says. \u201cWe love working together and whenever the situation allows we do it and we get fantastic results to this day.\u201d On the night I speak to Sancious, Springsteen and the E Street Band are on stage in front of 60,000 people in Berlin. It feels appropriate to ask: with hindsight, would he have still walked away? \u201cThere is a whole life I would have missed out on,\u201d he says. \u201cWorking with all these other artists and making my own music. If I had to do it again would I do the same thing? Absolutely. Because I didn\u2019t walk away from anything \u2013 I walked towards something.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "Areputation for wit is often a burden \u2013 people expect bon mots to drop constantly from your lips \u2013 but no one ever wore their reputation for wit more lightly than the great American singer-songwriter Tom Lehrer, who hasdied aged 97. Lehrer admirers all over the world know his witticisms from his concert recordings. \u201cIf, after hearing my songs, just one human being is inspired to say something nasty to a friend, or perhaps to strike a loved one, it will all have been worthwhile,\u201d he said. A doctor became a specialist, \u201cspecialising in diseases of the rich\u201d. And Lehrer reflected on protest singers: \u201cIt takes a certain amount of courage to get in a coffee house or a college auditorium and come out in favour of the things that everybody else in the audience is against, like peace and justice and brotherhood and so on.\u201d But Lehrer turned his back on fame and fortune in 1960, and after 1972 he spent most of his time teaching at the University of California, Santa Cruz. His students and close friends say he was wonderfully funny, scattering witticisms like confetti. Most of them are lost, but I\u2019ve retrieved a few unknown Lehrer anecdotes. In 1943, aged 15, Lehrer applied to go to Harvard, and was accepted because he was a mathematics prodigy. His application took the form of a poem, that finished: But although I detest Learning poems and the rest Of the things one must know to have \u2018culture\u2019, While each of my teachers Makes speeches like preachers And preys on my faults like a vulture I will leave movie thrillers And watch caterpillars Get born and pupated and larva\u2019ed And I\u2019ll work like a slave And always behave And maybe I\u2019ll get into Harvard \u2026 During his study there, the art historian Paul Turner (now of Stanford University) remembers a group sitting on the bank of the Charles River singing songs about their home towns, such asChicago. Turner complained there was no song about his home town of Schenectady. Lehrer replied that there was, and sang: \u201cThe toe bone Schenectady the foot bone, the foot bone Schenectady the ankle bone\u2026\u201d In 1970, a British graduate student at Harvard asked for an interview. Lehrer was inclined to refuse, but agreed because it was the young man\u2019s ticket to a job in journalism in London. He told him he was now \u201con that vague borderline between adolescence and senility. I\u2019m hoping to hang on to go from the world\u2019s oldest adolescent to the world\u2019s youngest dirty old man.\u201d The interview did its job. The student got his job in journalism and is now the celebrated historian and member of the House of LordsPeter Hennessy. For 30 years beginning in 1972, Lehrer\u2019s working life was teaching two courses at Santa Cruz. One was a mathematics course for students whose main subject was something else \u2013 he called it \u201cMaths for Tenors\u201d. The other was a course on The American Musical. It was work he loved, and his students loved him. But he was a private man, he disliked fame, and he did his best to live as though it had not happened to him. He was indifferent to money \u2013 he had enough for his needs, and no interest in acquiring more \u2013 so he put a legal instrument on his website allowing anyone to do anything they liked with his work, without paying him royalties. This is in amazing contrast with most high-profile performers, who have international legal teams to guard their intellectual property. In 2008 he was visited in Santa Cruz by Norwegian journalist Erik Meyn, who had set up a Tom Lehrer channel on YouTube without asking permission, and felt guilty about it. Lehrer explained that he didn\u2019t mind, and even insisted on paying for their lunch: \u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it.\u201d Lehrer\u2019s copyright decision gave rise to two shows which make their cheerful way round London\u2019s theatres and occasionally further afield. One isStefan Bednarczyk\u2019s one-man show The Elements of Tom Lehrer. The other is my play, Tom Lehrer Is Teaching Math and Doesn\u2019t Want to Talk to You, with Shahaf Ifhar as Lehrer, which includes many of his greatest songs but also tries to get to the truth about this extraordinary and enigmatic man. I think it succeeds as far as anyone has ever succeeded, which is not very far.",

        "raw_text": "Tom Lehrer, the acclaimed humorist and pianist whose satirical songs made himone of America\u2019s favorite prophets of doombefore he retreated to academia, has died, US media reported on Sunday. He was 97. The singer-songwriter died on Saturday at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, his friend David Herder said, according to the New York Times. Lehrer\u2019s sardonic numbers, backed up by a dazzling prowess at the piano that reflected his love for up-tempo Broadway show tunes, enchanted audiences in the 1950s and 60s. But Lehrer was always much more than the sum of his parts. A child prodigy, he graduated from Harvard at 19 and later taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Well ahead of his time on issues including pollution and nuclear proliferation, Lehrer made his mark with biting humor and zany rhymes. He was also wickedly funny on random subjects including murder, conjugal discord and chemistry. Poisoning Pigeons in the Park, one of his signature tunes, conjures up a couple enjoying a spring pastime of slaughtering pigeons with strychnine \u2013 \u201cIt just takes a smidgen!\u201d Underlying the song was the Boston authorities\u2019 method of pigeon control, using strychnine-treated corn. Another song, Folksong Army, mocked 1960s protesters. But his activism was persistent, with songs including Who\u2019s Next about nuclear weapons, and Pollution warning that: \u201cYou can use the latest toothpaste, then rinse your mouth with industrial waste.\u201d The seemingly bottomless well of sly, even cynical creativity captured audiences from 1953 until it appeared to go dry in 1965, although Lehrer briefly returned to performing in 1972 for a children\u2019s public television show, The Electric Company. Rumor had it that Lehrer stopped composing when his prophecies began coming true, or that he quit in protest over Henry Kissinger being awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1973. But Lehrer, in an interview with the satirical news website the Onion in 2000, dispensed with the second rumor, saying he had \u201cquit long before that happened\u201d. There was nothing abrupt about it, he said. \u201cI figure I wrote 37 songs in 20 years, and that\u2019s not exactly a full-time job. Every now and then I wrote something, and every now and then I didn\u2019t. The second just outnumbered the first.\u201d He claimed to have gone \u201cfrom adolescence to senility, trying to bypass maturity\u201d. While most of Lehrer\u2019s compositions were original, one adaptation stood out for its genius: his dizzying 1959 recitation of the chemical elements in the periodic table (102 at the time) to the tune of A Modern Major General from the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta The Pirates of Penzance. The piece earned adoration from none other than the Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe. \u201cTom Lehrer in my opinion is the cleverest and funniest man of the 20th century, and he\u2019s kind of my hero,\u201d Radcliffe said, before singing a rendition of The Elements on a British comedy show in 2010. That performance was partly responsible for the music comedian Weird Al Yankovic awarding Radcliffe the role of Weird Al in Yankovic\u2019s satirical biopic. \u201cSinging that song is an extremely nerdy thing to do,\u201dYankovic said of Radcliffe\u2019s rendition. \u201cIt\u2019s off-the-charts nerdy. And I thought, \u2018OK, this guy gets it. This guy\u2019s a kindred spirit. He can embody me onscreen.\u2019\u201d Posting to Instagram on Sunday, Yankovic wrote: \u201cMy last living musical hero is still my hero but unfortunately no longer living. RIP to the great, great Mr. Tom Lehrer.\u201d Born on 9 April 1928 to a secular Jewish family, Lehrer grew up in Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. He attended the prestigious Horace Mann and Loomis Chaffee preparatory schools before entering Harvard at 15, graduating magna cum laude with a degree in mathematics three years later. He went on to teach mathematics at MIT as well as Harvard, Wellesley College and the University of California, Santa Cruz. This article was amended on 28 July 2025 to give 102 as the number of chemical elements in Tom Lehrer\u2019s 1959 song about the periodic table. An earlier version gave 118. Context was also added for a reference to the song Poisoning Pigeons in the Park.",

Fans at home will be able to watch the procession via an ongoing live stream of theSabbath bench. Fans from across the world \u2013 including the Canadian R&B megastar Drake, who was passing through the city on tour \u2013 have travelled toBirminghamto pay their respects to Osbourne. Iqbal said that he had been moved by accompanying fans in a line to sign a book of condolences, and that Osbourne had put \u201cBirmingham on the map. He put Aston on the map.\u201d In June, Osbourne and Black Sabbath were given the Freedom of the City ahead of theirBack to the Beginning gig,a mammoth, all-star show paying tribute to Osbourne as he and Black Sabbath gave their final live performance. The event is said to have raised more than \u00a3140m for local charities fundraising for children\u2019s causes and treatment of Parkinson\u2019s, which Osbourne was diagnosed with in 2003. Evoking David Bowie\u2019s death just days after the release of his final album, Blackstar, in 2016, Osbourne died 17 days after the performance, at home in Buckinghamshire. Thousands of fans are expected to attend the event: Birmingham council has encouraged mourners to turn up early, and roads will close from 7am. A book of condolences will remain open at the Birmingham Museum and Art gallery, where the exhibitionOzzy Osbourne (1948-2025): Working Class Heroremains open. In 2011, Osbourne told the Times what he hoped for from his funeral. He didn\u2019t care about the music, he said. \u201cBut I want to make sure it\u2019s a celebration, not a mope-fest.\u201d This article was amended on 30 July 2025. An earlier version said Back to the Beginning raised more than \u00a31m for charity; however, this figure is estimated to be more than \u00a3140m.",

        "raw_text": "In 2023, the four women of Blackpink \u2013 Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Ros\u00e9 \u2013 stood on top of the world. In the seven years since their 2016 debut, the K-pop quartet became the biggest girl group of all time, off the back of delirious hooks, hard-ass stunting, cut-glass choreography and relentless work. With billions of streams, sold-out stadiums and YouTube viewership records in their wake, the group became the female face of the boundary-annihilating force that isK-pop, taking pandemonium and hype as its calling card; with the exception of their slender physiques, everything about the band was huge. Their 2023 headliner set at Coachella \u2013 the first Asian and all-female group to headline one of North America\u2019s largest music festivals \u2013 served as ajet-fueled exclamation pointon global domination. I stood in the crowd that night feeling like I\u2019d been leveled by a sonic boom, in the best way. Much has changed in the two short years since then. The band went on unofficial hiatus for each member\u2019s respective solo careers, and the four subsequent releases \u2013 Jennie\u2019s Ruby, Jisoo\u2019s Amortage, Lisa\u2019sAlter Egoand Ros\u00e9\u2019s Rosie \u2013 all attempted to escape the Blackpink shadow with halting success; the group\u2019s two rappers, Lisa and Jennie, also launched English-language acting careers on HBO, in The White Lotus and The Idol, and returned to Coachella as solo acts with plenty of bombast but less horsepower. The once ascendant wave of K-pop, buoyed up by the massive crossover success of Blackpink and all-male peers BTS,stalled out abroad and lost traction at home, global ambition and misfiring albums costing musical identity and momentum. The pop banger remains, however, a universal, enduring language, and at New York\u2019s Citi Field on Sunday night, Blackpink flexed their mastery of the genre with a tour of their energy drink-style hits \u2013 unabashedly manufactured, relentlessly upbeat, the highs jagged, aggressive and borderline hallucinatory. Just two years after their last world tour, Blackpink is back for what is billed as a reunion, with the band in a precarious if still victorious position; the last North American stop of their Deadline World Tour (is the deadline age? Solo success? Fleeting consumer attention?), at a stadium in one of the largest Asian American communities in the US, is an undeniable celebration, a spectacular if familiar show of force. It\u2019s also evidence of the wandering focus of a band now comfortably at the top; despite the alleged urgency of the deadline, the 2.5-hour show is more slack than Blackpink standard, the girls still stunting but no longer out for the kill. (With the exception of Lisa, the group\u2019s hardest member by far, who remains lethal, her dancing never less than crisp.) Numerous times during the group\u2019s typically maximalist set \u2013 three acts and an encore, spliced with two-to-three-song solo diversions for each member \u2013 I caught the look of fatigue on their faces. A drop of the elbow here or a slip of the mean mug there, though quickly smothered by the pyrotechnics, army of industrial backup dancers, lasers, general swirl of stadium sound and camera work that largely denied the pleasure of seeing all four in formation, in favor of one or two singers at a time. And fair enough \u2013 the New York July night was so oppressively humid that I was dripping in sweat just standing there; after the head-banging bombast of Boombayah, all four were forced to acknowledge the air\u2019s palpable resistance to any movement, or as de facto spokesperson Ros\u00e9 put it: \u201cIt is REALLY hot today.\u201d The goodwill of faithful Blinks \u2013 fittingly for the band, a stadium of many languages, diehard adults next to awed children with merch-toting parents in tow \u2013 largely covered for any lapses, and was rewarded with high-octane delights. New single Jump, making the girl power lineage explicit \u2013 \u201cSo come up with me, I\u2019ll take you high / That prima donna, spice up your life\u201d \u2013 layered itchy club beat, weapons-grade bass and tweaking choreography with lasers, fireworks and smoke for a full dose of undiluted, undeniable hype that got the crowd up. At their best, the siren call of \u201cBlackpink in your areaaaaaa\u201d remains as potent as ever. Less so with the solo diversions, each introduced with interludes of overdone music video imagery of the luxe life \u2013 Vegas and city lights, diamonds and furs \u2013 that underscored their relative lack of precision. Jennie delivered obligatory stunting, Jisoo sensible pop, Ros\u00e9 surprising ballads \u2013 her solo section, in which she went full Taylor Swift mode with the guitar, provided the most western-style pop moments of the show. If the solo sections hammered home one impression, it\u2019s that Lisa alone, in her dragon-skin suit and formidable sneer, has the jet fuel for a solo career. Also, that as a unit, the members\u2019 combined strengths covered their weaknesses like an airtight shield. It was a palpable relief, then, when they reunited following Ros\u00e9\u2019s turn for the pure force of breakout track DDU-DU DDU-DU, the wattage re-upped by camaraderie and their view of the finish line. Individually, they are pop artists in a crowded field, each neutralized and overwhelmed by the familiar elements around them. Together, they steamroll. And so it was that Sunday\u2019s finale of Like Jennie, in which all four came together to perform a song that Jennie just performed solo, briefly showed the stamp of Blackpink magic: the beat rips, the head-bopping with slick glasses is distinctly Jennie, but nothing hits quite like the four of them moving together.",

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. The music industry has long held mixed feelings about Spotify\u2019s extensive influence over artists \u2013 and these feelings have intensified amid ongoing controversy over Spotify\u2019s chief executive, Daniel Ek,leading a \u20ac600m (A$1.07bn) investmentinHelsing, a German defence technology company specialising in AI-driven autonomous weapon systems. Ek is also chair of Helsing, having joined the board in 2021 when his investment fund Prima Materiaput \u20ac100m intothe then-startup. In response to Ek\u2019s investment, artists and listeners have been seeking alternatives. \u201cFuckSpotify,\u201d the prolific Australian psychedelic rock group King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizardsaid in a social media poston Saturday, announcing they would be removing their catalogue from the streaming service. They followed US bands Xiu Xiu and Deerhoof, who made the same decision in recent weeks. Whether you\u2019re motivated by joining artists in leavingSpotify, or you\u2019re just interested in seeing the alternatives, it can seem daunting to make the switch after years of being with the service. But it is really easy. Streaming services tend to not have lock-in contracts, so if you\u2019re looking to switch, the first step would be cancelling your existing subscription through the account settings. Depending on when you subscribed, you\u2019ll be able to keep the premium features until the next payment is due. So what are the options? WhenApple Musiclaunched, it felt clunky and limited. But it has come a long way in the past few years, with vast improvements to its functionality, music selection (over 100m songs), radio, playlists and other features such as music videos which Spotify doesn\u2019t have. The user experience now seems much closer to Spotify. Apple also has launched lossless and spatial audio for a better listening quality. Lossless audio is something Spotify promised in 2021 but has not launched. If you\u2019re already in the Apple ecosystem this is definitely the best option, but there is also an Android app. Apple offers one month for free to new users but after that subscriptions are A$12.99 (US$10.99 and \u00a310.99) a month, with family plans at A$19.99 (US$16.99 and \u00a316.99) a month. There are also bundled subscription deals with Apple\u2019s other services, such as iCloud storage and Apple TV+. If you pay for aYouTubepremium subscription \u2013 A$16.99 (US$13.99 and \u00a312.99) a month \u2013 you get YouTube Music for free. It has over 100m songs and you get access to ad-free YouTube videos along with it. It also has playlists and radio stations and other features you would see elsewhere. As withApple Musicand its ecosystem, if you\u2019re already an Android user, this is an easier option for you. Amazon Music is included in Amazon Prime for A$9.99 (US$10.99 and \u00a38.99) a month. This tier comes with over 100m songs, podcasts and playlists, but users who want a more deluxe experience may opt for the pricier category, Amazon Music Unlimited, for A$12.99 (US$11.99 and \u00a311.99), separate from Prime membership. Unlimited comes with lossless and spatial audio tracks. If you want to avoid giving three of the largest tech companies your money, though, there are a growing number of other options. Tidal has always been pitched as the service that compensates artists the best and offers the highest audio quality. Like the other services, it has a catalogue of over 100m tracks. Pricing is A$12.99 (US$10.99 and \u00a310.99) a month, with an optional add-on for DJs offering stem separation for tracks. In addition to high-quality audio and all the expected features, Tidal has more than 650,000 videos and concert live streams. Other non-major companies offering music listening alternatives include Bandcamp, Napster (yes, the former peer-to-peer filesharing service has gone legal), Qobuz and Pandora. The biggest issue for people looking to switch is transferring your long-curated playlists. This is made easier through third-party services. If you want it to be fast you\u2019ll have to pay but if you don\u2019t have many to transfer or have the time, you can usually convert one playlist at a time for free. Popular options include the app SongShift (although it is only available on iOS) and Soundiiz (which runs in a web browser). You\u2019ll need to give whichever app you choose access to the accounts you are switching over but you can remove access once you are done. The services will usually flag if a song on the playlist can\u2019t be found. Sometimes it\u2019s as simple as a mismatch with the exact name of the song and it can be found as a different mix or title. The companies tend to keep the information about how much they pay artists for each stream a closely guarded secret but areport from industry blog Trichordist in 2020gives us a picture of the rough payments artists can expect. According to the report, Spotify pays US$0.00348 a stream, Apple Music pays US$0.00675 a stream, Amazon pays US$0.00426, Google pays US$0.00554 and Tidal pays US$0.00876. Surprisingly, the fitness company Peloton comes out on top of the list, paying US$0.03107 a stream. Napster also rates higher than others at US$0.00916. But if you want to support artists more directly, you can buy vinyl, or digital copies of the music through iTunes or similar services, or pay directly through Bandcamp or SoundCloud.",

        "raw_text": "Before I became a paramedic, I didn\u2019t expect the job would change how I load a dishwasher. Or eat a sandwich. Or look at trampolines. I knew it would change how I see others \u2013 watching people die tends to do that. But nearly 10 years in, I\u2019ve realised how much it\u2019s quietly altered my day-to-day life. Being a paramedic makes you see danger everywhere, so you avoid risks because you\u2019re always expecting you\u2019ll need to spring into action, even when you\u2019re not in uniform. Once you\u2019ve seen as many stretchers loaded with avoidable disasters as I have, you end up wired differently, and always brace for the next catastrophe. I can\u2019t walk into cafes, living rooms or kids\u2019 birthday parties without conducting a risk assessment. I look for the nearest exits and sharp corners and often wonder if that defibrillator sitting on the wall covered in dust still works. At a party I once caught a toddler chewing on a deflated helium balloon. His parents were deep into their fourth round of Aperol spritzes, so I had to gently explain to them that a balloon can block an airway faster than you can sing Happy Birthday. It\u2019s from experience more than from anxiety. A loose paver. Stray grapes. A poorly timed bomb into a pool. You stop seeing everyday life as nonthreatening once you\u2019ve spent 45 minutes tearing apart someone\u2019s lounge room on your hands and knees looking for a button battery in the hope it\u2019s not halfway down a digestive tract. I will never again get on a motorbike, or on a trampoline. No judgment to the people who ride them. Or bounce on them. But I\u2019ve been to too many scenes where someone came off second-best to physics. Motorbikes and trampolines both offer the illusion of freedom \u2013 right until the moment your femur is split into six parts. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning One of my first traumatic jobs involved a man who was clipped at an intersection. His helmet survived but his spinal cord didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen legs detached, ribcages shattered and vital organs thrown three metres from where they belonged. Trampolines have morbid minds of their own. I once treated a child who launched clean off the mat and on to a garden stake. Now, every time I see someone weaving through traffic in shorts and thongs \u2013 or letting their kid somersault unsupervised on a back yard trampoline \u2013 I think: \u201cThat\u2019s too much paperwork for my day off.\u201d I guess you could call it pattern recognition. I don\u2019t touch recreational drugs \u2013 not that I would have anyway \u2013 because I\u2019ve seen what happens when people assume their party cocaine isn\u2019t laced with fentanyl. The Pulp Fiction-style overdoses aren\u2019t fiction any more. And after watching the ketamine I\u2019ve administered turn people into catatonic zombies, I\u2019ve got no desire to try it myself (unless I take up trampolining and end up with a fractured femur). But just as I\u2019ve learned to fear what others overlook, I\u2019ve also stopped worrying about some of the things that send everyone else into a panic. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of people who\u2019ve called an ambulance because their smartwatch told them their heart rate was \u201celevated\u201d or \u201cirregular\u201d. Some were convinced they were having a heart attack because the little waveform on the screen looks vaguely medical, as if a cheap wrist sensor compares to our $50,000 ECG machines. It\u2019s usually anxiety. Or coffee. We also get alerts triggered by watches mistaking burpees for car accidents, or older people dropping their watches on the tiles and the sensor thinking they\u2019ve fallen. It\u2019s becoming the new version of rolling on to your VitalCall pendant in your sleep. I\u2019m not anti-technology. I think these devices have their uses. But increasingly, people are outsourcing common sense to apps. Algorithms don\u2019t do context. Maybe strapping on and plugging into these devices is our attempt to control life\u2019s inevitable chaos, as if a notification might keep death at bay. But I\u2019ve seen too much in my time to believe that kind of insurance is possible. Death doesn\u2019t scare me any more. I\u2019ve just learned to see it coming because I\u2019ve seen it turn up in all the places you don\u2019t expect. Like during a jog. Or in a McDonald\u2019s toilet. Even halfway through mowing the lawn. I just assume the universe is indifferent. If anything, this has made me calm. Because I\u2019m useful in a crisis, I\u2019m more patient with people who panic over minor things. If someone cuts their hand on a poorly stacked knife in the dishwasher, I don\u2019t stress. I grab a tea towel and tell them if they apply some pressure, they\u2019ll live. You Went to Emergency For What?by Tim Booth is out now (Pan Macmillan Australia, $36.99)",

As 22-year-olds itching for adventure, my wife and I, and one of our closest friends, nonetheless decided to fly from the UK to Australia and spend six months road-tripping through the outback. We were driving 250km from Julia Creek to Mount Isa in Queensland, in a Ford Econovan that had seen better days. About 50km short of the town, there was a loud bang beneath the van and the fuel level started dropping rapidly. A stone had pierced the rusty petrol tank and our petrol had drained on to the road \u2013 all of it except for the spare metal jerrycan that we\u2019d kept for emergencies. The van quickly stopped running. But to our unbelievable good luck, we were only about 100 metres from a rest stop, to which we pushed the van in the baking morning heat. Parked in the rest stop was a new, high-spec camper van. With recent news headlines in mind, we were apprehensive about approaching a stranger in the middle of nowhere \u2013 we\u2019d spooked ourselves out a couple of times already on the trip \u2013 but we didn\u2019t have many options. We knocked on the door to be greeted by a barrel-chested Aussie halfway through having a shave. We asked for any suggestions as we were in dire straits. In another moment of unbelievable good luck, the man turned out to be a retired mechanic, who fixed the jerrycan to the engine. That held long enough for us to get the van to Mount Isa where he and his wife very kindly followed us \u2013 almost another three hours\u2019 drive away \u2013 to make sure we didn\u2019t get taken advantage of by the local mechanic. We bought the man, whose name was Pete, a pack of XXXX Gold beer to say thanks. I distinctly remember him downing one, opening a second, and downing that too. Pete and his wife told us they had kids who were travelling in England at the time and they would have wanted strangers to help them if they needed it. We got extremely lucky with Pete and his wife.

        "raw_text": "Igrew up in the bush, and in 1966, as soon as I was old enough, I ran off and joined the navy. I loved the job and was having a ball. Three years in I was offered a rare opportunity to train for a top-secret role at a base in Queensland. Me and the two other girls were to be deployed to Singapore 12 weeks later. That was before my radio broke down. One afternoon, midway through my stay in Queensland, I had some issues with my electronics and called for a technician. I\u2019d expected to get my radio repaired and get on with the day, but then the most gorgeous guy I\u2019d ever seen walked right in and changed the course of my life. John was as cool as a cucumber as he got to work and I was struck dumb, just in awe of this incredibly handsome man. I didn\u2019t know how I was going to get him to notice me, but I was determined. A few days later there was a social evening at the base. It was casino themed and I spent the night following John around, making sure I was always in his eyeline. It wasn\u2019t the most sophisticated tactic, but it worked. By the end of the evening he\u2019d asked me out. Our first date was seeing Johnny (as he was then) Farnham sing at Lennon\u2019s hotel in Toowoomba and it was perfect. We stole as many nights out together as we could over the next six weeks and I was going more and more gaga by the day. As my time at the base came to an end I still wasn\u2019t sure if John wasasswept away by our romance as me. He always played it so cool. As we approached my last night, he arranged a getaway at Noosa to go surfing together and a stay at a motel. In 1969 this was very risque, but I had zero hesitation. Somewhere in the middle of the night he asked casually: \u201cWhat would you say if I asked you to marry me?\u201d If this was a hypothetical question, he had no hope of getting out of it. I flew right off the bed, jumped on top of him and yelled at the top of my lungs: \u201cYes, yes, yes!\u201d I didn\u2019t give it a second thought. We set the wedding date for October \u2013 just a few months later \u2013 and I had to request a discharge from the forces; back then women couldn\u2019t serve if they were married. The whole time I was back down south John wrote me letters \u2013 30 in all. I still have them. They were so full of love and adoration and excitement about the future we were going to have together. It was like living in a dream. Then it was time for him to drive the 1,700-odd kilometres to Menindee, where I was from \u2013 a tiny, one-horse town on the Darling River and 100km out of Broken Hill. As his little red Datsun came up the dirt road, my stomach lurched. For the briefest second I was seized by uncertainty. I couldn\u2019t even remember how tall he was. But the moment he stepped out of the car, I fell into his arms and those worries dissolved. The love I felt for him was so overwhelming. I knew this was going to be the best thing that ever happened to me. I was so smitten with John, there\u2019s no doubt we rushed into things. We really knew nothing about each other. It turns out we\u2019re exact opposites, but are such a wonderful foil for each other\u2019s personalities. I think my lively nature has kept him interested all these years, while his calmness has kept me grounded. Our first child lived for just half an hour, and while it isn\u2019t always the case, that terrible time really brought us closer together. When our son and daughter arrived safely in the coming years, I felt like the luckiest mum in the world. At a time when not all husbands were so supportive, John encouraged my desire to study to become a teacher. And just like always, once I knew he had faith in me, I felt I could do anything. To this day I wonder about how I knew, or if it was just amazing luck. But either way I\u2019ve been married to the love of my life for over 55 years, so my instincts weren\u2019t bad. He\u2019s still just as gorgeous to me today as he was that afternoon in 1969. Being with John has always felt to me like living under a lucky star \u2013 everything seems to work out just how it\u2019s supposed to. Do you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

        "raw_text": "I was very clear about wanting a family earlyin our relationship, but after two and a half years together my partner has admitted he doesn\u2019t want kids. This is the best relationship I\u2019ve had \u2013 he\u2019s kind, patient, supportive, and we have the best sex. We\u2019re both anxious people with avoidance issues, but I felt safe and\u00a0cherished until last year, when I\u00a0discovered he had cheated.He said it was an attempt to \u201cescape\u201d.I was deeply shocked. I ended the relationship, but he begged for another chance and accepted an ultimatum: commit toliving together, getting a dogand starting a family(thingsI told him I wanted early on). Heagreed to the first two,but said he needed more time for the last. I am 38 and asked repeatedly for honesty about children, fearing the same heartbreak I felt with my ex\u2011husband. Yet he kept it ambiguous, only to finally admit that he doesn\u2019t want childrenbutis afraid to lose me. I respect that it\u2019s his decision, but I\u2019m hurt and angry about being misled. I am a touring artist, which makes starting a family challenging, and it feels impossible to do it alone. I fear that if I can\u2019t make music \u2013 vital for my emotional and financial wellbeing \u2013 I\u00a0may succumb to thedepression and repeat the grim fate ofmy parents. After years of dating, I can\u2019t seem to find anyone I have much in common with who wants a family.The thought of ending up alone and childless terrifies me.I am trying to thinkof an alternative solution but, if I\u2019m being honest, anything other than having a family with the person you love and who loves you back feels like a compromise. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve been lied to. I feel that your inner voice has been screaming at you, but somewhere along the line you\u2019ve learned to reason away your feelings. This man doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s the one for you. He has\u00a0lied and he has cheated and you deserve better than to be scrambling around the \u201cgood bits\u201d to somehow convince yourself that you need to make this work. You don\u2019t. When you are in a situation that feels stuck, it\u2019s impossible to imagine solutions, or a life better lived. I consulted relationship therapist Joanna Harrison, who said: \u201cI can see that wherever you look it feels like there\u2019s mourning to do [for your parents\u2019 depression, your ex-marriage, your current situation]. You sound like someone who battles on alone, and perhaps this was essential with parents who were depressed.\u201d I wonder whether you could seek sometherapyto tease out the threads of your past life with someone who is \u201con your side\u201d, and to explore the loops that keep repeating. Both Harrison and I also wondered if your current relationship only seemed \u201ckind and supportive\u201d compared with past ones. If so, there are other kinder, more supportive relationships you may yet strive for. Harrison added: \u201cOne longitudinal study of parents showed that in a sample of couples who had a baby when there had been a strong difference of views about having a baby, in all cases the couples had separated by the time their first child went to primary school. It\u2019s very painful for couples to be faced with a situation where there is no compromise, and it is very upsetting to lose the relationship and have to make this decision.\u201d But I\u2019d add that it would be easier in the long run than an unsatisfactory compromise. Also, why should you alone compromise? That would eat away at you in a different way. As your inner voice is saying: you need to try.

        "raw_text": "Joan MacDonald is an influencer. There\u2019s no other word for it, though she winces a little when she says it. But she is an influencer, and an extremely successful one. The fitness maven has been on the covers of magazines such as Women\u2019s Health, modeled as part of lucrative brand deals and launched her own fitness app, Train With Joan. OnInstagram, where she has more than 2 million followers, she shares pictures of herself posing in bikinis in picturesque locales and training at the gym in color-coordinated workout sets. But there\u2019s one small difference between MacDonald and many other social media starlets. She is 79. \u201cI was 70 when I started [working out],\u201d MacDonald says on a video call from her home in Ontario, white hair elegantly coiffed. \u201cI keep thinking I\u2019m in my 30s.\u201d MacDonald\u2019s workouts are intense, whether you\u2019re 30 or 70. She does deadlifts, weighted planks and kettlebell swings, and casually lifts dumbbells the size of fire extinguishers over her head. Her arm muscles could put professional rugby players to shame. She is arguably the most famous older woman lifting heavy, but she\u2019s far from the only one. There\u2019s Ernestine Shepherd, 89, who has more than 101,000Instagramfollowers and calls herself \u201cthe world\u2019s oldest living female competitive bodybuilder\u201d. Nora Langdon, in her 80s, recently shared avideoof herself deadlifting 225 pounds. And earlier this year, theNew Yorkerpublished a documentary about Catherine Kuehn, who brokemultipleworld records for deadlifting in her 90s. Many of these lifters seem to delight in bucking the stereotype of the frail old woman who needs help carrying her groceries. \u201cOnce you reach a certain age, it\u2019s like you can\u2019t do anything any more,\u201d MacDonald says. \u201cTrainers and coaches dumb down everything for older people, but old people are capable of more than they think.\u201d As they age, women\u2019s physical abilities are often underestimated by others as well as themselves, says Elaina Manolis, a physical therapist and assistant clinical professor at Northeastern University.

Manolis says the menopausal and post-menopausal women she works with often need help unlearning the negative messages about exercise they absorbed growing up. \u201cThis is a generation that has been wired to think women should never be in the gym,\u201d she says. MacDonald and Shepherd remember worrying they would \u201clook manly\u201d when they started lifting. \u201cAt the beginning, I thought, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be lifting weights, I\u2019ll look like a guy,\u2019\u201d recalls MacDonald. \u201cBut that\u2019s just brainwashing. [Women] are told that so much that we believe it.\u201d Women who avoid strength training are robbed of its benefits, many of which are especially helpful for ageing bodies. In addition to building muscle \u2013 which one can do at any age, Manolis notes \u2013 strength training has a significant impact on bone health and cognitive function. The former is especially important for women, who have a much higher risk of developing conditions that weaken the bones, like osteopenia andosteoporosis. And it\u2019s fun. Shepherd says that as soon as she started strength training, her favorite thing about it was \u201cthe joy and the way that you felt\u201d. She and her sister started lifting when they were in their mid-50s, and soon they were training others and building a community. \u201cI would wear what my trainer would call my \u2018costumes\u2019,\u201d she says \u2013 shorts, crop tops, leopard-print leggings. MacDonald says she faced some criticism from people in her life when she first started working out and posting about it on Instagram. \u201cI got some really awful remarks from people I thought were my friends,\u201d she says. They commented on how she dressed \u2013 \u201cbecause I wear form-fitting clothing\u201d, MacDonald says \u2013 and her growing public profile. \u201cThey said I didn\u2019t have to prance around and keep telling people what I was doing,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s not what old women are supposed to do. You\u2019re sort of told, \u2018Go quietly out the back door, will you?\u2019\u201d Sign up toWell Actually Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life after newsletter promotion Attitudes are shifting, though. Manolis says she has lots of patients coming to her saying: \u201cI know I should start [lifting], I\u2019ve been listening to a lot of podcasts.\u201d And this is the first year the National Senior Games \u2013 an Olympic-style, multi-sport competition event for adults over 50 that takes place biennially in the US \u2013 will include a powerlifting competition. \u201cOver the last three or four years, more and more people have been asking me when we\u2019re going to add [powerlifting],\u201d says Sue Hlavaseck, president and CEO of the National Senior Games Association (NSGA). Roughly 12,400 athletes are expected to participate in this year\u2019s National Senior Games, which are taking place in Des Moines, Iowa, at the end of July. Of those, 187 will be participating in the powerlifting competition \u2013 99 men, aged 54 to 95, and 88 women, aged 50 to 82. The oldest female competitor, 82-year-old Faith O\u2019Reilly, says a friend took her to a powerlifting meet in her late 30s. \u201cI was watching everybody and I thought, \u2018Well, I can do that,\u2019\u201d she says. O\u2019Reilly has been lifting ever since. \u201cIt suits me,\u201d she says. She likes setting goals for herself, and enjoys the camaraderie of gyms and meets. And she appreciates the independence and confidence it has brought her. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked being able to do things,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what powerlifting can do for you \u2013 you can handle your grandchildren, and your sacks of groceries.\u201d Regardless of age, if you\u2019ve never picked up weights before, it\u2019s best to start by working with a trainer or physical therapist who can help with form and individual needs. \u201cIn most gyms that I\u2019ve been in, people are happy to help,\u201d says O\u2019Reilly. Total beginners can see significant improvements in strength fairly quickly, says Manolis. She\u2019s had patients say that after four to six weeks of training they were able to get out of a chair without using their hands, walk up a full flight of stairs, vacuum the whole house or load a dishwasher for the first time in years. \u201cAs we age, what we really want to do is to keep our independence and remain functional,\u201d Manolis says. Strength training facilitates both of these things. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a cure-all. \u201cBeing healthy and living life to the best of your ability doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to be happy every day, or that you\u2019re going to be without pain or accidents,\u201d MacDonald says. \u201cThese things happen, but that\u2019s life. You\u2019ve got to keep pushing forward.\u201d",
